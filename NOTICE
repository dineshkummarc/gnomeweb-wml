Please take notice that gnomeweb-wml does not compile with LANGUAGE, LANG
and LC_ALL set. So please do unset these before trying.

Also if you for instance install the pages into /home/httpd/www.gnome.org
by running for instance:

./autogen.sh --prefix=/home/httpd/html && make install
 
then you also need to edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to reflect this.
Otherwise the menus, and images does not work correctly

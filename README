WML docs: http://www.engelschall.com/sw/wml/

Most things are in place now. Issues and things that need to be resolved:

* The news items on the front page are static. A script is needed to leech
  the headlines from news.gnome.org and put them on here.

* Fallback is required on two things. The first is the navigation on the
  subpages (now uses layers, should have an alternate version with the full
	menu for each of the three sections, with a brief description of each thing
	to justify that the intermediate page is there), and the second is PNG/GIF
	fallback. I think perhaps both can be solved with Apache's mod_rewrite, to
	rewrite URLs based on browser version, but this needs to be done. Also,
	someone needs to hack a little WML to do the alternate navigation, and we
	need a script to batch convert the PNGs to GIFs. Should be simple.

* I need to make each of the banner titles for the subpages.

* Content is needed. :)

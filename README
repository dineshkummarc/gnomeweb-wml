This is a WorkInProgress

I'd like to formalize the pages that need to be navigable to from any
given page:

. All ancestors of the current page
. All immediate children of the current page
. All siblings of the current page.
. All toplevel pages
. If any of those lists are too long to be displayed, then you need to be
able to provide a "..." link that has a list of all those pages on a
separate page.

TODO:
  High priority:
	. Figure out what markup tags are needed for content.

	. Create template pages and documentation to ease new content
	creation.

  After that (for content):
	. Figure out the directory hierarchy and navigation items.
	. Put things in place.
	. Create dynamic content manipulation/presentation pages.

  After that (for layout):
	. Come up with final design.
	. Solidify navigation presentation.

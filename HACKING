Only registered GNOME Website medical staff may check in changes without
approval. They are listed in the MAINTAINERS file. The other people who can
check in changes without approval are the dudes who manage their own little
areas on the website, such as module maintainers and their helpers.

There are a few things anyone can do, which will please more people that it may
inconvenience, so you're welcome to do these at any time:

  - Fixing up typos such as spelling and grammar mistakes

  - Fixing up broken html bits

  - Fixing up standards-breaking pages

  - Eliminating EVIDENCE OF EVIL such as images-as-text, font tags, and
	anything else that doesn't help us shift towards XHTML Strict

Otherwise, please mail gnome-web-list@gnome.org and ask for permission.

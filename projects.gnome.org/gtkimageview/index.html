        <p>
            This is the humble home of the GtkImageView widget. It had
            its previous home at <a href =
            "http://trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/">trac.bjourne.webfactional.com/</a>
            but I have now decided to give it a new home at the GNOME
            infrastructure.

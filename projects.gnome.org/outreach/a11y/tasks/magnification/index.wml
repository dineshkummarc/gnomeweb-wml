<h2>Magnification</h2>

<b>Mentor:</b>: <i>To be defined.</i>
</p>

<p>
See <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519080">bug 519080</a> to track this task.
</p>

<p>
Overall, our ultimate goal is to let us get as good as or better than <a
href="http://www.aisquared.com/index.cfm">ZoomText</a> as well as support new
innovative accessibility features that can be enabled by the X COMPOSITE
Extension. This USD$6K/6mo task is to get us on the path to that goal.
</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
The gnome-mag module provides a magnification service via ORBit/Bonobo. It also
uses the <a href="http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/CompositeExt">X
COMPOSITE Extension</a> to provide smoother and full screen magnification. In
general, it works :-), but there are some performance
concerns and some feature enhancements that could be done.
</p>

<p>
Coming down the pipe is potential huge conflict: window managers are becoming
COMPOSITE managers. We see this with the sexy effects of Compiz, and Metacity
is also becoming a COMPOSITE manager. Since there can be only one COMPOSITE
manager, the result is that gnome-mag's current form may not work when these
new window managers are in use. In addition, there are some emerging magnifiers
as well, such as <a href="http://dev.beryl-project.org/~kristian/category/summer-of-code/">eZoom for Compiz</a>.
</p>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>

<p>
See the <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-accessibility-list/2008-February/msg00066.html">recent
GNOME accessibility community discussion</a> on this topic.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The COMPOSITE extension opens the world for us to do lots and lots of really cool manipulation of what's being displayed on the desktop. This goes well beyond bit zooming and lets us get into really neat and useful stuff that can benefit a larger number of disabilities.</li>
  <li>The architecture of the COMPOSITE extension seems to be that the most effective use of it is if you are in the process of the thing acting as the COMPOSITE manager.</li>
  <li>As we see with Compiz and Metacity, people seem to be centering on the window manager as the COMPOSITE manager.</li>
  <li>We have a desire to for external processes (e.g., Orca) to communicate with features provided by the COMPOSITE manager, such as magnification. Other things beyond magnification include highlighting a character/word/sentence/line/object/etc. of interest, providing tools for on screen keyboard to provide better visual experiences, etc.</li>
  <li>We may need to consider systems where COMPOSITE may not be available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
This 'magnification' task is larger than magnification (maybe we need to rename
it something like CIMSITY -- COMPOSITE Interface for Magnification Services and
other Interesting TechnologY ;-)). The current task proposal is to create a
growable API that starts off by supporting at least what we need for
magnification, but which will also eventually allow us to do other really
really cool stuff. This API (most likely DBus based?) and an implementation of
it will need to be available for the GNOME platform (e.g., in a revised
gnome-mag, in metacity, or in something else). In addition, it must also expose
itself as a service so that assistive technologies such as <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca">Orca</a> can influence
what is being magnified and/or highlighted and how it is being magnified and/or
highlighted. The person doing the work should also provide a migration path
away from the current gnome-mag solution to the new solution (e.g., "how will
it work with Orca?") and get buy-in from at least the GNOME community that this
will be a supported solution.
</p>

<p>
Someone well versed in the actual use cases of magnification by people with
visual impairments should be consulted as part of this work -- magnification is
far more than bit zooming. Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Di√≥genes (the last
maintainer of gnome-mag) has written <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/carlosd/">some thoughts</a> on this as a potential
starting point.

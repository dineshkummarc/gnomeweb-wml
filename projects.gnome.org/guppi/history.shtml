      <p><h1>History</h1></p>

<p>
In the summer of 1998, 
<a HREF="mailto:hp@pobox.com">Havoc Pennington</a>
and
<a HREF="mailto:trow@gnu.org">Jon Trowbridge</a>
began working on the first incarnation of Guppi.  It was to be written in
C++, using the Gtk-- library.  Work progressed for several months, but was
abandoned; Gtk-- was not sufficiently stable, and did not support GNOME.
Fixing and extending Gtk-- was taking too much time away from work on
Guppi.  The code from this abortive attempt is kept in the <tt>guppi</tt>
module on the GNOME SVN server.
</p>

<p>
In the fall of 1998, the second incarnation of Guppi was launched.
C++ remained the implementation language, but the decision was made to
just use the straight gtk+ library.  Havoc wrote 99% of the code for
this version, and it had many good features, including:
<ul>
<li> It actually did something.  Scatter plots more-or-less worked
pretty well.
<li> It replaced the gdk-level drawing of the previous version with
a canvas-based architecture.
<li> It was well integrated with guile.
</ul>
There were several tarball releases, but development ground to a halt
in the summer of 1999 when Havoc went off to join
<a HREF="http://www.labs.redhat.com">RHAD Labs</a>.  The code from
this effort can be found in the <tt>guppi2</tt> module on the GNOME
CVS server.
</p>

<p>
In the fall of 1999, Jon resurrected Guppi development.  After
spending several weeks studying and tinkering with the <tt>guppi2</tt>
code base, he decided to start again.  This time, the decision was
made to work in C, rather than C++, in an attempt to generate broader
developer-interest in the project.  This is <tt>guppi3</tt>, the
current incarnation.  Hopefully the third time will indeed be the
charm.

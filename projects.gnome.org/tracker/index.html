	<h2>What is Tracker?</h2>
	<p>Tracker is a
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search"
	alt="">semantic data storage</a> for the desktop and mobile
	devices. It allows the user to keep track of the data stored
	on their devices and on-line sources and extract
	relationships in an automated fashion. Tracker 
	uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/" alt="">W3C</a>
	standards for <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"
	alt="">RDF</a>
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology"
	alt="">ontologies</a>
	using <a href="http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/"
	alt="">Nepomuk</a>
	and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/"
	alt="">SPARQL</a> to query and update the data.</p> 

	<h2>What does that mean?</h2>
	<p>Tracker is an all-in-one indexer, search tool and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata"
	alt="">meta-data</a> database. It is designed to extract
	information and meta-data about your personal data so that it
	can be searched easily and quickly. Part of this extraction
	includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_text_search"
	alt="">full text searching</a> (FTS) which allows indexing of
	the content in documents and other files so you can find the
	file you are interested in if it contains the
	word <q>management</q> in it (for example).</p>

	<p>Tracker is a central repository of <strong>user</strong>
	information, that provides two big benefits for the desktop;
	shared data between applications (it doesn't matter what the
	source is once it's stored in the repository) and linked
	information from different sources (mixing contacts with
	files, location, activities and etc.).</p>
       
	<p>This central repository can work only with a very well
	defined data model, that applications can rely on to store and
	recover their information. That data model is defined using a
	semantic web artifact called ontology. An ontology defines the
	concepts (classes) and properties (attributes) that the items
	in the repository can be or have.</p>

	<p>There is an EU-funded project called Nepomuk, where a core
	of ontologies to model the Desktop were defined. This set was a
	very good starting point for Tracker but new requirements and heavy
	development in collaboration with applications provided a very
	valuable feedback, in form of fixes and extensions. Some of this
	work is already submitted for approval in the upstream version, but
	the process is long and hard, so the Tracker ontologies are
	diverging slowly.</p>

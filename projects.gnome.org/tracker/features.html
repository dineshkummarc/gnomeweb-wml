<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Supports both free text search (like Beagle/Google) as well as structured searches using RDF Query.</li>
	<li>Responds in real time to filesystem changes, automaticaly keeping its metadata database up to date.</li>
	<li>Extracts file contents as plain text and indexes them.</li>
	<li>Can provide thumbnailing on the fly if a thumbnail does not currently exist.</li>
	<li>Uses multilingual word stemmers to help find more relevant results. For example a search for motorbikes (plural) will also return results relevant to motorbike (singular).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Desktop Neutral Design</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Adheres to freedesktop thumbail spec.</li>
	<li>Uses freedesktop technologies like DBus and XDGMime.</li>
	<li>Uses XDG utils like xdg-open.</li>
	<li>Implements the freedesktop specification for metadata (http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards/shared-filemetadata-spec).</li>
	<li>Supports the WC3's RDF Query syntax for querying that metadata.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Efficient and Stable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Written in C for maximum efficiency.</li>
	<li>Designed and built to run well on lower-memory systems with typically 128MB or 256MB memory. Typical RAM usage is 3-9 MB.</li>
	<li>High performance indexer capable of indexing 100+ text files a second.</li>
	<li>Scheduled nicely so that you can work and use your machine without noticing any slow downs.</li>
	<li>Extractors run in separate processes, so a crash in one will not bring down the daemon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Components</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Indexer, a lightweight daemon that extracts information from files (trackerd).</li>
	<li>Tracker Search Tool, a small GUI to search for indexed data.</li>
	<li>Command line tools for searching, querying the daemon status, and tagging.</li>
	<li>libtracker, a C wrapper around the DBus API.</li>
	<li>Full DBus API for application authors using different toolkits or programming languages.</li>
</ul>


<h3> Use Cases </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Application-neutral and desktop-neutral tagging. Tagging support 'for free' in any application that uses Tracker, such as Nautilus and file-chooser dialogs.</li>
	<li> A cross-application metadata database. If applications chooses to use Tracker as their metadata database and indexer, they would see signifigant improvements. Users would no longer need to add a MP3 they have downloaded to Rhythmbox, nor a photo they have taken to f-spot, these items would be detected and imported automatically.</li>
	<li> Users may completely move away from a folder-heirarchy based home folder, and instead organise their data into collections using tags. The combination of tagging support in the file-chooser, tagging awareness in Nautilus, or even a tag based filesystem using FUSE could allow radical exploration of new desktop ideas.</li>
	<li> Improved performance. With an always running indexer, application start-up time could be dramatically reduced in instances where applicaions scan or parse a numer of files on disk. For example, Alacarte could use it as its desktop file parser, or Rhythmbox as its song index. In addition, by using a DBus-based API, one can take advantage of asynchronous replies for improved GUI responsiveness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Object store</h3>
Tracker can also provide a user definable object store (for things like notes, playlists, contacts, etc) complete with user-definable properties (metadata). Using Tracker as a storage base has a number of benefits:
<ul>
	<li>Automatically indexed via crawler or notifications frameworks. </li>
	<li>Embedded metadata and text contents are fully extracted and indexed for storage and high speed search.</li>
	<li>Extensible metadata and tags. All entities can have an almost infinite number of properties which can be application or user-defined.</li>
	<li>Persistent internal storage of objects removes the need for storing them externally if desired.</li>
	<li>Link and define explicit relationships between different objects.</li>
	<li>Easily exploitable and shareable via high level and rich Dbus based interfaces.</li>
	<li>Searchable and queryable by content or by any criteria. Provides one of the richest and most powerful search frameworks currently available.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tagging</h3>
Tags are one-word labels that you can assign to any file to help you categorize and remember them. 
<ul>
	<li>You can assign as many tags to a file as you like and rename or delete the tags later.</li>
	<li>You can organize, under a logical tag, several files in different folders and retrieve all of them using the common tag.</li>
</ul>

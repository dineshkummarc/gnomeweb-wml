<h2>The Mission of the GNOME LiveCD</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a LiveCD to demonstrate
GNOME. The initial motivation was to be able to send a GNOME LiveCD to
journalists and news agencies so that they can test and talk about
GNOME without installing it, but others have expressed interest as
well. The infrastructure for this will be flexible, so that it can be
easily customized and re-targetted- for example, to distribute a
version with a custom splashscreen for a specific conference, to
change the language for distribution by non-en_US gnome groups, or to
change the software set to market to different groups (artists,
developers, etc.)</p>
<p>Currently, downloading and playing with GNOME is a high-investment
activity. We do a release, and reviewers and new users just have to
take it on faith that it is interesting, or worse, they have to build
the whole thing. Even on distributions where up-to-date packages are
available, it's still a big investment to figure out what distro you
are on (if you're already on linux, which a lot of the people we want
to reach out to aren't) and then download everything, make sure your
deps are right, and get it all installed.</p>
<p>This difficulty in downloading puts GNOME at a serious disadvantage
relative to, say, Open Office or Firefox, where reviewers and new
users can download one rpm or tarballs, install, and say 'huh, I like
this', 'here is what is good about this', etc. For them, simple
download means word of mouth is easier, identity as a project for
reviewers is easier, big splash ('million downloads in the first
day!') so on, so forth.</p>

<p>The goal of the liveCD is to fix these problems, as much as is
possible for a large and complex project like ours. We want to make
playing with GNOME and the linux desktop easy and informative- i.e.,
someone should be able to download /one/ file, play with it for a
while, learn about the desktop, and think 'I want to use GNOME, let me
go install it for real', or 'GNOME is really (easy to
use|powerful|whatever), I should tell people about it.'</p>

<p>There are lots of secondary reasons:</p> 

<ul><li>to have something to give out at conferences, etc., that 'is'
GNOME- it helps people retain positive associations with the project,
have something to show people after they go home, etc.</li><li>to give
LUGs something to do easy demos with.</li><li>provide a platform on
which other people can build similar demo discs, which hopefully will
have the associated benefit of showing off GNOME. Like, if
OpenOffice.org wanted to build a demo CD, we'd hope they'd base it off
our LiveCD, hence showing off GNOME along the way.</li><li>show off
the GNOME 'family' of applications- things like HAL, gtk/gnome-based
apps (inkscape, f-spot, etc.)</li><li>demonstrate open standards and
formats, and interoperability with proprietary formats where
appropriate.</li></ul>

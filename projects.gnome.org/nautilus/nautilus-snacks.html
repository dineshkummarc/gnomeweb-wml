  <h1>Snack-size Nautilus Hacks</h1>

  <p>This is a list of some Nautilus hacks that would be nice to have for 2.6. They aren't really bite-size - a list of bite-sized tasks would be too hard to maintain. These tasks will take a certain amount of research and planning, and will almost certainly need a few rounds of review to get right.</p>

  <h2>Selection-sensitive side pane</h2>

  <p>The side pane is currently geared toward showing information about the current directory. It would be nice for it to try to show more about the selected files. Some possibilities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Show a "zoomed in" version of each file in the Information side pane. Show all of the information types from the Icon Captions for each selected file.</li>

    <li>Maybe provide all of the Open As actions on the side pane for the selected files</li>

    <li>Change the notes pane to show notes for selected files instead of just the current file/directory. This will make notes much more useful.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Things and files to look at:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nautilus file attributes, and reading them asynchronously. See <i>nautilus/docs/nautilus-io.txt</i></li>

    <li>Registering for and receiving selection change notifications, <i>nautilus/libnautilus/nautilus-view.h</i>, <i>nautilus/src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c (change_selection)</i></li>

    <li><i>nautilus/src/nautilus-information-panel.c</i></li>

    <li><i>nautilus/components/notes/</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rearrangable list-view columns</h2>

  <p>This would have two parts: First, all of the things that you can show as icon captions in the icon view should be made available as list view columns. Second, there should be a way to edit which columns are available. There is a column editor in libegg, this could probably be integrated. Or maybe the columns could use the same choices/priorities as the icon view.</p>

  <p>Things and files to look at:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nautilus file attributes, and reading them asynchronously. See <i>nautilus/docs/nautilus-io.txt</i></li>

    <li><i>libegg/libegg/column-chooser/</i></li>

    <li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c</i></li>

    <li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-list-model.c</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recursive permissions</h2>

  <p>The way MacOSX does this makes sense - they have a button underneath the permissions that says "Apply to Folder Contents" or something like that. <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~dave/screenshots/Screenshot-Nautilus-PermCustom.png">This screenshot</a> shows a possible new layout for permissions. One benefit of this layout is that "Read And Write" is more easy to apply recursively, because a Read and Write file should probably be +rw, while a Read and Write directory should probably be +rwx.</p>

  <p>Things and files to look at:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Glob Selection Dialog</h2>

  <p>People want to be able to perform operations on sets of files. Rather than implement filtering, we want to implement a simple dialog that lets users specify a pattern to search for. When they're done, the file window should select all files that match this pattern.</p>

  <p>Things and files to look at:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c</i></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Per-window Hidden Prefs</h2>

  <p>Whether to show hidden files should be a per-window preference rather than a global one. <i>mathieu is planning to work on this</i></p>

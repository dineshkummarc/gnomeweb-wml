    Take control of your inbox!  With Evolution's junk filtering, you're
    free to read the email you want and not see much of the email you don't.
    Bayesian-based junk filtering with optional remote rules get rid of all
    of the emails which bug you most.
  </p>

  <p>
    Junk filtering is easy, too.  You can either select "Mark as Junk" under
    the edit or context menu &mdash; or simply click the junk button on the
    toolbar.  
  </p>

  <h3>Search Folders</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="images/screenshots/2.0/evo-vfolder.png" class="img-inline"><img src="images/screenshots/2.0/thumb-evo-vfolder.png"></a>
    See your email the way you want it.  Search Folders are saved intelligent
    searches which can display groups of email according to user-specified
    criteria.  Create Search Folders to combine mail from different mail
    accounts into a single view, quickly view all mail from your boss (or a
    particular friend :) &mdash; and new in 2.0, optional include entire
    threads in the results!
  </p>

  <h3>Integrated Security</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="images/screenshots/2.0/evo-security.png" class="img-inline-right"><img src="images/screenshots/2.0/thumb-evo-security.png"></a>
    Evolution includes support for signing and encrypting mail via GPG
    (GNU Privacy Guard) and S/MIME.  Encrypting mail helps you protect
    your privacy and helps those receiving your mail know its really
    from you.  Evolution 2.0 includes a handy interface to help you
    manage your GPG keys and S/MIME certificates as well as a place to
    manage keys and certificates which have been shared to you. 
  </p>

  <h3>Desktop Integration</h3>

  <p>
    By using the evolution-data-server, other GNOME applications are
    integrating with Evolution.

    <ul>
      <li>gnome-panel calendar applet lists your appointments and tasks.</li>
      <li>Synchronize your <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> buddies
          with your Evolution contacts.</li>
      <li>View <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Planner">Planner</a>
          files as Evolution task lists.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Filters</h3>

  <p>
    Filters enable you to organize your mail as it arrives or on request.
    Filters allow you to bundle, sort and distribute mail into various
    folders or otherwise process mail.  You can create multiple filters to
    perform multiple actions.  For example, your filters could put copies
    of one message into multiple folders, or keep one copy and send one to
    another person, and it can do that quickly.
  </p>

  <h3>Searching</h3>

  <p>
    Evolution automatically indexes messages so searching for that long
    lost email is faster and easier than many other mail clients.  
  </p>

  <h3>Web Calendars</h3>

  <p>
    You can add your favorite Web calendar so you can see upcoming football,
    movie or DVD releases, or a friend's schedule inside of Evolution.  One
    of the most popular sites for Web calendars is
    <a href="http://icalshare.com/">iCalShare</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Collaboration Server Support</h3>

  <p>
    Evolution includes support for Microsoft Exchange, Novell GroupWise and
    <a href="http://www-old.kolab.org/about-kolab-clients.html">Kolab2</a>
    servers. You can configure Evolution to act as an client for any of these.
    The Evolution team is looking to support more collaboration servers,
    especially those based on open standards. If you are involved in such
    a project, please let us know so we can add it to this list!
  </p>

  <h3>Multiple Account Management</h3>
  <p>
    Account management tools let you receive, manage and organize messages
    from multiple email accounts or collaboration servers. Create new mail
    accounts easily with the Evolution account assistant.

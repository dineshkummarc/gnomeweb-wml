Aug 12 06:04:17 <chen>	Lets get started right away. I see almost everyone is already here :)
Aug 12 06:04:24 <chen>	hello all!
Aug 12 06:04:45 <chen>	So we have branched evolution packages for 2.28!
Aug 12 06:04:57 <chen>	http://mail.gnome.org/archives/evolution-hackers/2009-August/msg00016.html has more details
Aug 12 06:05:14 <chen>	We have started the planning page for evolution 3.0 (or maybe 2.30 ?)  - http://www.go-evolution.org/Evo3.0 . Just a initial document which will be populated..
Aug 12 06:05:43 <chen>	mbarnes will be adding more tasks on porting deprecated modules as part of GNOME 3.0 goals
Aug 12 06:06:27 <chen>	We have the UI freeze in place for gnome-2-28 branch and string freeze coming up on aug 24 - just to keep things known
Aug 12 06:06:48 <chen>	the master branch is free of all freezes now and waiting for the big merges to happen
Aug 12 06:07:18 <chen>	I have informed ross to merge the address-book/calendar dbus ports this week
Aug 12 06:08:14 <chen>	mbarnes would be merging the kill-bonobo branch after fixing some blocking bugs there in calendar and we have a dead-line for it until aug end and will merged anyway by that time
Aug 12 06:08:43 <chen>	though if it has major blockers at the end of aug.
Aug 12 06:08:50 *	jony_ is now known as jony
Aug 12 06:09:35 <chen>	starting initially we were thinking of two people working on kill-bonobo merge to fix regressions and two people on eds-dbus-port
Aug 12 06:09:58 <chen>	kill-bonobo mbarnes and mcrha. eds-dbus-port myself and abharath 
Aug 12 06:10:15 <mcrha>	the rest of 3.0 to jony. Sounds good ;)
Aug 12 06:10:17 <chen>	and jony will be pitching in if he gets some time
Aug 12 06:10:29 <jony>	mcrha: right ! :D 
Aug 12 06:10:36 <chen>	mcrha, he would be more involved in mapi :)
Aug 12 06:10:43 <abharath>	:D
Aug 12 06:10:45 <mcrha>	yup yup
Aug 12 06:11:24 <chen>	so this is the plan to start with and we need to get the tasks for porting deprecated modules and share them
Aug 12 06:11:53 <chen>	so initial efforts will go on to make evolution usuable for 2.29.1 after the merges
Aug 12 06:12:15 <chen>	evolution-exchange is going to require some work with both the merges
Aug 12 06:12:37 <chen>	so these are the areas we have thinking about..
Aug 12 06:12:45 <chen>	any questions/concerns ?
Aug 12 06:12:52 *	chen waits for mcrha :)
Aug 12 06:13:19 <mcrha>	yeah, I've ready a quite long essay of things, but you answered the questions from there, thus I'm quiet now
Aug 12 06:13:21 <mbarnes>	I don't know if the eds-dbus guys feel the same, but from here out please try to commit Evolution patches to kill-bonobo first and work backwards
Aug 12 06:13:26 *	andre crossing fingers that abharath or jony take a look at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580904 (libgnomeui in evo-exchange)
Aug 12 06:13:44 <mbarnes>	I spent two solid days merging 2.27.90 into kill-bonobo.  it's getting to be quite painful
Aug 12 06:14:00 <abharath>	andre: I'll take that up for the first 3 issues :)
Aug 12 06:14:04 <abharath>	others as I go
Aug 12 06:14:06 <mcrha>	mbarnes, oops, I'm sorry about that
Aug 12 06:14:35 <chen>	mcrha, so i guess we wont have much patches in evolution to commit right now and can freeze evolution changes,
Aug 12 06:14:43 <chen>	until kill-bonobo is merged
Aug 12 06:14:50 <chen>	sounds good ?
Aug 12 06:15:09 <mcrha>	chen, yeah, and that's making me wonder...
Aug 12 06:15:27 <chen>	i guess eds-dbus-port can go on its own and wont affect kill-bonobo much right ?
Aug 12 06:15:38 <mcrha>	is the only reason to pospone kb merge to "frozen" master the work eds-dbus? 
Aug 12 06:16:30 <mcrha>	as if it is not so, then why not to merge kb immediately? we should be able to make it fine in two moths
Aug 12 06:16:31 <chen>	mcrha, nope, i heard from mbarnes that calendar is broken and for dev's to start fixing bugs, it would good if it in a working state
Aug 12 06:16:49 <mbarnes>	chen: other than the e-d-s reset code in evolution's main.c (which I understand we'll be dropping), that's correct
Aug 12 06:16:50 <chen>	mcrha, so working in the same, able to start calendar..
Aug 12 06:17:42 <mcrha>	chen, so the master, until the eng of august, will be for eds-dbus port testing?
Aug 12 06:17:43 <chen>	mbarnes, so if it can be used a bit, the merge can happen anytime you prefer
Aug 12 06:18:02 <mcrha>	chen, and did you sau the calendar is done there, thus the eds is bonobo free since next monday?
Aug 12 06:18:20 <mbarnes>	okay.  I just don't want to block testing the calendar side of eds-dbus due to a broken calendar
Aug 12 06:18:21 <chen>	mcrha, yes calendar/address-book both are done
Aug 12 06:18:39 <chen>	mcrha, but there are bugs to be fixed
Aug 12 06:18:45 <chen>	mcrha, i heard from ross that,
Aug 12 06:18:48 <mcrha>	chen, good, let's see how well next week ;)
Aug 12 06:18:59 <chen>	they have the calendar port is in the open-hand branch
Aug 12 06:19:27 <mcrha>	chen, will there be any list of such bugs-t-be -done? preferable in bugzilla search or something
Aug 12 06:19:47 <mcrha>	I have one from mbarnes about kb, but no idea about eds-dbus
Aug 12 06:19:56 <chen>	mcrha, we have the bugs with white-board status which we will be continuing to use in the same way
Aug 12 06:20:06 *	mcrha can try to learn on eds-dbus until kb is in
Aug 12 06:20:19 <chen>	i think we have it with the tag dbus-hybrid for address-book dbus port bugs as of now
Aug 12 06:20:27 <andre>	openedhand bugzilla only lists 6 open bugs for eds-dbus
Aug 12 06:20:48 <mcrha>	chen, good, if you've an exact link...
Aug 12 06:21:05 <chen>	andre, one issue which i see is, they have not tested the authenticated backends as we came to know from address-book port testing
Aug 12 06:21:06 <mcrha>	will those foreign bugs be moved to gnome bugzilla?
Aug 12 06:21:08 <chen>	and exchange is broken
Aug 12 06:21:43 <chen>	andre, mcrha i just came to know about the bugs present there, so makes sense to move them to bgo after merge
Aug 12 06:21:53 <mbarnes>	mcrha: http://http://tinyurl.com/evolution-dbus-hybrid
Aug 12 06:21:54 <andre>	http://bugzilla.openedhand.com/buglist.cgi?product=EDS+(DBus+Port)&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED
Aug 12 06:22:11 <mcrha>	thanks
Aug 12 06:22:28 <chen>	cool
Aug 12 06:22:38 *	chen will go through them aftre the meeting
Aug 12 06:23:00 <chen>	anything else before we go around the room?
Aug 12 06:23:30 <chen>	let me start with my status,
Aug 12 06:24:22 <chen>	have been reviewing some patches last week for ui freeze, discussions over ds bugs, async operations and 2.22.90 release, branching
Aug 12 06:24:48 <chen>	with many meetings around the same :)
Aug 12 06:25:13 <chen>	thats it from my side and i will start fixing bugs on eds-dbus port as soon as its merged
Aug 12 06:25:32 <chen>	mbarnes, updates ? :)
Aug 12 06:26:11 <mbarnes>	I'm sure everyone can guess what I'm busy with...
Aug 12 06:26:18 *	chen is sure mbarnes is going to be relieved merging all the kill-bonobo changes into master soon :)
Aug 12 06:26:26 <mbarnes>	calendar is getting there.  kill-bonobo is sync'ed up with the gnome-2-28 branch point now
Aug 12 06:26:36 <mbarnes>	yes, very much  :)
Aug 12 06:26:42 <abharath>	nice
Aug 12 06:26:50 <chen>	mbarnes, awesome!!
Aug 12 06:27:02 <chen>	abharath, updates?
Aug 12 06:27:56 *	chen thanks andre for helping out on translation stuff for branching :)
Aug 12 06:28:08 <abharath>	chen: was onto fixing some issues with evoldap2 for openSUSE
Aug 12 06:28:16 <abharath>	chen: I'll be onto the GAL and eds-dbus port along with you
Aug 12 06:28:26 <chen>	abharath, thanks!
Aug 12 06:28:35 <chen>	andre, anything to share?
Aug 12 06:28:40 <andre>	nope
Aug 12 06:28:44 <chen>	EvaSDK, anything to share ?
Aug 12 06:29:12 <chen>	jony, any updates ?
Aug 12 06:29:15 <jony>	chen: nope.
Aug 12 06:29:44 <chen>	mcrha, any updates ?
Aug 12 06:29:49 <mcrha>	made Matt's life harder with commits to master, otherwise on calendar bugs, plugin bugs and mapi bugs. Looking forward for all the new work after merging The Things.
Aug 12 06:30:09 <chen>	cool
Aug 12 06:30:19 <chen>	seb128, anything to share?
Aug 12 06:30:35 <seb128>	not really, is anybody still working on 2.28?
Aug 12 06:30:48 <mcrha>	translators ;)
Aug 12 06:30:49 <seb128>	(some distro plan to ship that with GNOME 2.28 ;-)
Aug 12 06:31:18 <chen>	seb128, thinking of only blockers as of now..
Aug 12 06:31:25 <seb128>	not really
Aug 12 06:31:40 <seb128>	but I see lot of talk about master and none about 2.28
Aug 12 06:31:47 <seb128>	so I was just wondering ;-)
Aug 12 06:32:04 <chen>	seb128,  http://mail.gnome.org/archives/evolution-hackers/2009-August/msg00016.html has some info for 2.28 :)
Aug 12 06:32:05 <seb128>	I know breaking things is lot of fun compared to bug fixing
Aug 12 06:32:18 <seb128>	but users expect something they can use still meanwhile ;-)
Aug 12 06:32:33 <seb128>	ok good
Aug 12 06:32:53 <chen>	seb128, so i have been discussing about ds bugs a bit for 2.28 with srini, we keep you informed about how it goes
Aug 12 06:33:06 <chen>	i guess that is the one major thing apart from blockers
Aug 12 06:33:21 <seb128>	ok thanks
Aug 12 06:33:24 <seb128>	right
Aug 12 06:33:37 <seb128>	nothing else from me, 2.27.90 seems quite stable
Aug 12 06:33:48 <chen>	nice to hear that :)
Aug 12 06:34:00 <chen>	we have associated some names with tasks,
Aug 12 06:34:24 <chen>	but that will be changed based on the bugs we get, so next one month after merges happen,
Aug 12 06:34:52 <chen>	we will have a clear idea on how much efforts would be need and can be shared along..
Aug 12 06:35:13 <chen>	Thats all we have for the meeting today :)
Aug 12 06:35:22 *	jony (~jjohnny@ecoprobe-dmz.gns.novell.com) has left #evolution-meet
Aug 12 06:35:28 <chen>	Lets meet next week with more updates!
Aug 12 06:35:35 <seb128>	thanks chen
Aug 12 06:35:39 <mcrha>	see you
Aug 12 06:35:41 <chen>	Thanks and bye all

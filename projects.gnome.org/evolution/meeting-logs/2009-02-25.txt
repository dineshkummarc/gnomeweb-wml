Feb 25 05:00:56 <srag>	Hello everyone
Feb 25 05:01:05 <srag>	we can wait for another 1minute
Feb 25 05:02:03 <seb128>	hey srag
Feb 25 05:02:42 <srag>	I can see a shorter list on the right side :(
Feb 25 05:02:55 <srag>	anyways, lets move on
Feb 25 05:03:29 <srag>	We would be having 2.24.5 today
Feb 25 05:03:47 <srag>	and thanks a lot for mbarnes for sharing the build/release responsibility with me
Feb 25 05:03:58 <seb128>	yeah for mbarnes!
Feb 25 05:04:01 <srag>	I would be pretty busy for the next 1 month or so, with Novell work
Feb 25 05:04:56 <seb128>	will you still look at evo bugs and roll 2.25 and 2.26 tarballs?
Feb 25 05:04:59 <srag>	We didn't add much features on 2.26.x and andre rightly mentioned that 2.26.0 would be a stable release of 2.26.0
Feb 25 05:05:05 <seb128>	or is mbarnes going to do those?
Feb 25 05:05:17 <srag>	seb128, I would still fix bug, and do tarballs in between
Feb 25 05:05:26 <srag>	Im not loading mbarnes fully :).
Feb 25 05:05:36 <seb128>	srag: I think that's doing stabilization is a good choice
Feb 25 05:05:45 <srag>	sure
Feb 25 05:06:02 <srag>	in a couple of weeks or so, I would have a good idea on what would be our take on 2.28.x
Feb 25 05:06:22 <srag>	my next 1 month work would answer a lot on those lines.. <some confidential internal work
Feb 25 05:06:43 <srag>	otherwise, things are just normal here
Feb 25 05:06:58 <srag>	I should be clearing hte patch backlogs from now on
Feb 25 05:07:02 <srag>	I did clear ~20 yesterday
Feb 25 05:07:13 <srag>	and we should be back to a controlled number in a week or so
Feb 25 05:07:30 <srag>	Thatz it from my side
Feb 25 05:07:52 <srag>	mbarnes, anything to share with us ? good luck with 2.24.5 release :)
Feb 25 05:08:47 <srag>	abharath, anything to share with us ?
Feb 25 05:09:10 <abharath>	srag: nothing much. Just working on some bugs. nothing much to add
Feb 25 05:09:31 <srag>	abharath, PST is new in 2.26.x right ?
Feb 25 05:09:40 <abharath>	srag: ;)
Feb 25 05:09:41 *	srag is lost in his current work
Feb 25 05:09:54 <abharath>	I had asked you to add it to our page :D
Feb 25 05:10:08 <srag>	abharath, infact I added ot the GNOME RoadMAP/release notes iirc
Feb 25 05:10:14 <srag>	chen, anything to share with us ?
Feb 25 05:10:25 <srag>	chen, I had CCed you on some patches that mcrha asked me to look at
Feb 25 05:10:29 <abharath>	srag: okies. Haven't checked
Feb 25 05:10:34 <chen>	srag, making some fixes in evolution-sharp and restarted to work on sharepoint connector
Feb 25 05:10:53 <chen>	srag, i have already started looking into some of the patches
Feb 25 05:11:20 <srag>	incase, others didn't know, chen had a working mono-based e-d-s loaded and he had written initial calendar backend for Microsoft SharePoint
Feb 25 05:11:30 *	mcrha would prefer all, not "only" some ;)
Feb 25 05:11:56 <mbarnes>	srag: nothing specific this week.  just fighting through a bunch of crap so I can continue with kill-bonobo
Feb 25 05:12:01 <chen>	mcrha, right :)
Feb 25 05:12:07 <srag>	mbarnes, cool.
Feb 25 05:12:09 <srag>	chen, sure.
Feb 25 05:12:35 <srag>	seb128, you can see if you want to package the Sharepoint connector to Ubuntu. Its based on Mono
Feb 25 05:12:37 <chen>	srag, I will be sharing the information on them about the work done sometime this week..
Feb 25 05:12:49 <srag>	mbarnes, I know RHE doesn't ship mono, but for Fedora you can think of it
Feb 25 05:13:13 <seb128>	srag: I don't really know about mono but if you have a tarball I can try to get somebody in the ubuntu community to look into that one
Feb 25 05:13:40 <srag>	sure seb128 , as chen said, he would share infos once he has some concrete things
Feb 25 05:13:48 <chen>	It would require another package called dice. I will share the detailed information on everything required
Feb 25 05:14:02 <srag>	sure chen
Feb 25 05:14:08 <srag>	lakhil, anything to share with us ?
Feb 25 05:14:18 <lakhil>	srag, bug triaging and sle testing , nothing much  
Feb 25 05:14:30 <srag>	lakhil, any blockers you ahve for 2.26.0 ?
Feb 25 05:14:40 <lakhil>	nothing from my side 
Feb 25 05:14:42 <srag>	Its better if you can list our MUST FIXES for trunk
Feb 25 05:15:08 <srag>	mcrha, anything to share with us ?
Feb 25 05:15:20 <mcrha>	actually not. as you said I gave you yesterday some patches for a review, which you delegated some to others, and more surprisingly, I was also given with some of other to review.
Feb 25 05:15:50 <mcrha>	lakhil, it's a short list for "fixes for trunk", just name them: evo, eds, eex, ema ;)
Feb 25 05:15:54 <srag>	:)
Feb 25 05:16:01 <lakhil>	lol
Feb 25 05:16:27 <srag>	mcrha, don;t give ideas to lakhil 
Feb 25 05:16:34 <srag>	seb128, anything to share with us ?
Feb 25 05:16:45 <srag>	howz 2.26.0 looking on Ubuntu?
Feb 25 05:16:58 <srag>	s/.0/.x
Feb 25 05:17:04 <seb128>	not really, I've been busy with other GNOME components recently, I've spent a good part of the day triaging evolution bugs yesterday though
Feb 25 05:17:10 <seb128>	2.25.91 seems quite ok
Feb 25 05:17:19 <mcrha>	srag, how is it going with the unread count issue? + unread in vfolders? people are really unhappy with that.
Feb 25 05:17:21 <seb128>	it still feels slugish after a while for me
Feb 25 05:17:42 <seb128>	do you do this sqlite cleaning now? or do you still get noise added with time?
Feb 25 05:18:09 <srag>	seb128, I still fix sqlite issues
Feb 25 05:18:16 <srag>	mcrha, unread vfolders ? 
Feb 25 05:18:16 <seb128>	otherwise no real blocker that I noticed but lot of small issues
Feb 25 05:18:24 <srag>	mcrha, or unread count in vfolders ?
Feb 25 05:18:30 <lakhil>	seb128, any plans to provide 2.24.4 / 5 to ubuntu 
Feb 25 05:18:32 <mcrha>	the latter
Feb 25 05:18:53 <srag>	mcrha, if they are having 2.24.4, unread counts in vfolder should be fine, except the UNREAD VFOLDER
Feb 25 05:19:12 <srag>	unread vfolder is a self modifying vfolder, which is a hacked out one post disk summary
Feb 25 05:19:12 <seb128>	lakhil: the new ubuntu version is planned in april so I'm not sure I want to spend days to stable updates for intrepid now
Feb 25 05:19:32 <srag>	mcrha, its scaring if they have 2.24.4 and still face issues
Feb 25 05:19:41 <seb128>	lakhil: especially that 2.24.4 has vfs changes which make me uncomfortable for a stable update ... but a contributor has picked the update task so let's see how it goes
Feb 25 05:19:53 <lakhil>	cool
Feb 25 05:19:56 <mcrha>	srag, ok, let's see. Thanks for the info
Feb 25 05:20:11 <srag>	mcrha, if you get some one, get all the information and pass to me
Feb 25 05:20:31 <srag>	seb128, the vfs changes should speed up a lot.
Feb 25 05:20:31 <mcrha>	be sure srag , be sure
Feb 25 05:20:47 <srag>	mcrha, Im sure mcrha :)
Feb 25 05:20:58 <srag>	mcrha, do you know of any issues ?
Feb 25 05:21:00 <seb128>	srag: right, I was just waiting to get those tested for a while before pushing to stable ;-)
Feb 25 05:21:08 <srag>	I haven't seen anything since we pushed it
Feb 25 05:21:12 <srag>	seb128, sure
Feb 25 05:21:33 <srag>	Anything else to discuss ?
Feb 25 05:21:48 <mcrha>	srag, except of above mentioned expunge, not at the moment. just you know, I'm trying to have my hands off the mailer as much as possible ;)
Feb 25 05:22:04 <srag>	mcrha, why are you getting off the mailer ?
Feb 25 05:22:14 <mcrha>	because it's broken ;)
Feb 25 05:22:18 <srag>	mcrha, where ?
Feb 25 05:22:24 <mcrha>	everywhere ;)
Feb 25 05:22:31 <srag>	you scare me mcrha 
Feb 25 05:22:34 <srag>	any bug ?
Feb 25 05:22:57 *	lakhil should quickly prepare a calendar bug list :P
Feb 25 05:23:04 <srag>	lakhil, hehe
Feb 25 05:23:09 <mcrha>	not as much, just people do not update so often and repeat with similar things, which are supposed to be fixed in newer version than they have
Feb 25 05:23:10 <srag>	I know your plans lakhil ;-)
Feb 25 05:23:40 <srag>	mcrha, you meant the users
Feb 25 05:23:52 <mcrha>	lakhil, be also sure you'll be able to convince chen for reviews
Feb 25 05:23:57 <mcrha>	srag, yup
Feb 25 05:24:24 <lakhil>	mcrha, :)
Feb 25 05:24:26 <srag>	mcrha, it should be fine, once we get to 2.26.0
Feb 25 05:24:40 <srag>	mcrha, don't leave your jump-across-module thing
Feb 25 05:24:47 <srag>	mcrha, we want you everywhere :)
Feb 25 05:24:59 <srag>	mcrha, so are you looking at seb128's expunge issue ?
Feb 25 05:25:05 *	mcrha is looking forward for a surprising experience in next release
Feb 25 05:25:17 <mcrha>	srag, not at all, it's a mailer, broken thing ;)
Feb 25 05:25:22 <seb128>	lol
Feb 25 05:25:32 <srag>	:)
Feb 25 05:25:34 <seb128>	mcrha: are you look to the calendar not sending meeting invitations? ;-)
Feb 25 05:25:44 <seb128>	looking
Feb 25 05:25:46 <srag>	hehe :)
Feb 25 05:25:51 <mcrha>	seb128, not yet, but will do ;)
Feb 25 05:25:58 <srag>	anyways, lets meet next week. Bye guys

Oct 07 12:05:32 <chen>	Lets get started in another minute and have a small discussion to know whats happening and moving further with coming releases
Oct 07 12:06:40 <mcrha>	"releases", hmm
Oct 07 12:07:07 <chen>	mcrha, yup we have 2.28.1 and 29.1 coming this month
Oct 07 12:07:53 *	mcrha was hoping in the upcoming year forecast :)
Oct 07 12:07:58 <abharath>	;)
Oct 07 12:08:09 <chen>	lol step by step
Oct 07 12:08:32 <chen>	as we all know dbus calendar has been merged now
Oct 07 12:08:33 <mcrha>	yeah, one big step, then few small steps
Oct 07 12:09:18 <chen>	and i would like lakhil to play a major part in bringing the major bugs during every meeting
Oct 07 12:09:49 <chen>	and we can share the bugs among us assigning and making sure the issues are fixed before the release
Oct 07 12:09:56 <lakhil>	chen, i keep sharing in irc daily ... though i will try to prepare one for meeting 
Oct 07 12:10:29 *	mcrha noticed flood of those yesterday
Oct 07 12:10:33 <chen>	prolly we can discuss over bugs like https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=557613
Oct 07 12:10:43 <chen>	to ensure they are fixed on time
Oct 07 12:11:08 <chen>	lakhil, bring it to light and discussing it would make sure these go in before the release
Oct 07 12:11:32 <lakhil>	yeah, sure 
Oct 07 12:11:37 <chen>	lakhil, would be great if you have a list before us during these meetings :)
Oct 07 12:11:46 <chen>	mcrha, and coming on patch reviews,
Oct 07 12:11:56 <chen>	know there are lot of ur patches waiting on the same
Oct 07 12:12:20 <mcrha>	actually, i changes a strategy slightly
Oct 07 12:12:33 <chen>	mcrha, can all the patches which are straight forward or if your confident on the fixes be committed directly ?
Oct 07 12:12:46 <chen>	and consult on the fixes where you have some doubt..
Oct 07 12:13:09 <mcrha>	I attach patches for "test or review", if reporter can try the patch and says ok, then I commit
Oct 07 12:13:50 <mcrha>	chen, yup, i can do that, I was hoping in starting with that on January, though
Oct 07 12:14:04 <chen>	mcrha, oh why ?
Oct 07 12:14:23 <chen>	mcrha, prolly you can attach the patch marking it as committed right away
Oct 07 12:14:30 <mcrha>	just for fun of attaching patches to bugzilla.
Oct 07 12:14:37 <mcrha>	does it worth it?
Oct 07 12:14:48 <chen>	mcrha, and the left ones means that they are requiring some review comment
Oct 07 12:14:52 <chen>	mcrha, don think so
Oct 07 12:15:11 <mcrha>	'don' ~~ don't?
Oct 07 12:15:28 <chen>	ok don't :)
Oct 07 12:15:44 <mcrha>	just clarifying a meaning.
Oct 07 12:16:08 <mcrha>	I do not think it worth it too, the commit ID should be enough there
Oct 07 12:16:15 <chen>	mcrha, i would say testing from the reporter is fine, but commit it if you feel the approach taken is correct
Oct 07 12:16:47 <chen>	mcrha, agree
Oct 07 12:16:53 <mcrha>	you know the code will be quite different when you allow me to commit without asking, right?
Oct 07 12:17:24 <chen>	mcrha, well we have all spent enough time to make a judgement whether the approach is right or wrong
Oct 07 12:17:42 <chen>	and of-course having a review is always better, but considering the ammount of people we have now
Oct 07 12:17:57 <chen>	we will not be able to follow the same style
Oct 07 12:18:24 <mcrha>	right, that's a bad thing (low human resources)
Oct 07 12:19:18 <chen>	mcrha, so if you have patches,
Oct 07 12:19:38 <chen>	which are on the above category commit them!
Oct 07 12:19:53 <chen>	i mean for the patches right now in the bugzilla as well
Oct 07 12:19:56 *	mcrha is wondering how chen means 'if' :)
Oct 07 12:20:10 <lakhil>	:D
Oct 07 12:20:24 <abharath>	:D
Oct 07 12:20:32 *	chen leaves the rest to mcrha :)
Oct 07 12:20:49 <mcrha>	patches in bugzilla, I miss the user statistic page there
Oct 07 12:21:07 <lakhil>	mcrha, now it's added back 
Oct 07 12:21:08 <abharath>	haha and lakhil the points page :D
Oct 07 12:21:14 <chen>	lol
Oct 07 12:21:18 <lakhil>	all are back :D
Oct 07 12:21:20 <mcrha>	chen, I'll go the safe side, killing master only
Oct 07 12:21:23 <abharath>	aah :D
Oct 07 12:21:31 <abharath>	mcrha: lol
Oct 07 12:21:41 <mcrha>	lakhil, is the statistics page back?
Oct 07 12:21:43 <abharath>	you the one who has to save the killing :D
Oct 07 12:21:49 <chen>	mcrha, ok, hold it on stable as well by ur judgement
Oct 07 12:21:54 <lakhil>	mcrha, yep 
Oct 07 12:22:17 <mcrha>	lakhil, good, let me look how I stand for past few weeks ;)
Oct 07 12:22:23 <chen>	to update what i have been doing,
Oct 07 12:22:36 <mcrha>	chen, yeah, stable is a different story
Oct 07 12:23:00 <lakhil>	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=weekly-bug-summary.html
Oct 07 12:23:03 <chen>	committed the imapx initial stuff to master and cooked a patch for ebook issue
Oct 07 12:23:23 <chen>	perhaps feel it has to be combined with mcrha's patch
Oct 07 12:23:31 <chen>	on keeping open ebook's in memory
Oct 07 12:23:57 <chen>	mcrha, i felt that the open ebooks can be kept in memory somewhere so that all components in evo can access them
Oct 07 12:24:07 <lakhil>	mcrha, https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=describeuser.html&login=mcrha... :)
Oct 07 12:24:09 <chen>	mcrha, would that be good ?
Oct 07 12:25:02 <chen>	would have to start more on imapx/dbus and issues in master
Oct 07 12:25:07 <mcrha>	chen, with the actual concept, only shell would do that, and that shouldn't look on address books at all
Oct 07 12:25:11 <mcrha>	lakhil, I see :)
Oct 07 12:25:17 <chen>	abharath, what were u upto last week?
Oct 07 12:25:46 <abharath>	chen: looking into the libmapi issue for now. before that the windows installers http://www.gnome.org/~pchen/bharath_windows_installers/
Oct 07 12:25:56 <chen>	mcrha, should be possible atleast for mailer right?
Oct 07 12:26:07 <abharath>	2.28 maybe I'll make an installer for that by this weekend
Oct 07 12:26:19 <mcrha>	chen, yup, there's a patch for maler already, I updated it some time ago, on your request
Oct 07 12:26:22 <chen>	mcrha, keeping book's in memory just for one purpose may not be optimal isn it?
Oct 07 12:26:34 <chen>	mcrha, will go through it again
Oct 07 12:27:04 <abharath>	and there's that bug on MAPI GAL which needs to be fixed now. I'll get you the bug details
Oct 07 12:27:22 <chen>	mcrha, somehow feel we really just open the book syncronously and so allocating the struct contents in heap is just a work-around
Oct 07 12:27:31 <chen>	mcrha, if the operation is not cancellable
Oct 07 12:27:47 <mcrha>	chen, they are there for two, one is for faces, other for image loading
Oct 07 12:27:49 <lakhil>	abharath, https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=595480
Oct 07 12:27:53 <chen>	mcrha, need to look at traces more to see if threading should be done somewhere else
Oct 07 12:28:20 <mcrha>	chen, let's discuss that after the meeting, it's quite low in the code now
Oct 07 12:28:22 <chen>	abharath, fine
Oct 07 12:28:28 <abharath>	chen: cool thanks
Oct 07 12:28:44 <chen>	abharath, let me know the bug on the build_cache and i can have a look at that since ur fully booked
Oct 07 12:28:51 <chen>	mcrha, sure
Oct 07 12:28:57 <abharath>	chen: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=595480
Oct 07 12:29:14 <chen>	lakhil, anything to share?
Oct 07 12:29:32 <lakhil>	chen, hard time with master .. found many crashes due to calendar-dbus changes ...all are getting logged in bugzilla 
Oct 07 12:29:50 <lakhil>	thanks to mcrha for his quick responses :)
Oct 07 12:29:56 <chen>	lakhil, with the white-board status ?
Oct 07 12:30:17 *	chen is yet to look into the bugs, have not looked into them last couple of days
Oct 07 12:30:17 <lakhil>	chen, http://tinyurl.com/yaeahsx
Oct 07 12:30:26 <chen>	thanks
Oct 07 12:30:54 <chen>	mcrha, anything to share?
Oct 07 12:31:30 <mcrha>	not much, I think. You probably noticed eex back in live, though some troubles arises, which are question for fix
Oct 07 12:31:37 <abharath>	I know mcrha feels too bad when chen say words like anything and if, but he doesn't mean that :)
Oct 07 12:31:50 <lakhil>	:)
Oct 07 12:31:56 <chen>	lakhil, from next meeting would leave the floor to you while we start the meeting and we can pick up the issues

Oct 07 12:32:15 <lakhil>	chen, :)
Oct 07 12:32:36 <chen>	ah don mean it in that sense :)
Oct 07 12:33:01 <chen>	am also little bit bad in english, maybe will improve it going further :)

Oct 07 12:33:29 <chen>	lakhil, don movie ? :)
Oct 07 12:33:34 <chen>	ah ok ok :)

Oct 07 12:34:55 <chen>	lakhil, sure
Oct 07 12:35:05 *	mcrha is wondering who the Colin Walters is
Oct 07 12:35:11 <chen>	lakhil, how about imap keyword for these bugs ?
Oct 07 12:35:30 <lakhil>	chen, nope .. we have 90% bugs on imap :P

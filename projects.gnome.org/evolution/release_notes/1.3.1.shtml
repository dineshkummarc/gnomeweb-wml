  <h2>Evolution 1.4 Preview 1 Release Notes</h2>

  <p>It is our greatest pleasure to announce the first preview release of
    Evolution for GNOME 2, Evolution 1.3.1.
  </p>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <table bgcolor="#fbe797" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="100%">            <tr>

  <p>The betas of Evolution are UNSTABLE.  This
    means that it will probably crash very often, and
    possibly eat your mail, calendar, appointments,
    anything.
    The purpose of this release is to help users to test
    the new code; use at your own risk, but please do
    report the bugs.  <font color=\"red\"><b>8^)</b></font>
  </p>

  <h3>Availability</h3>

  <p>
    In order to install this version, you have to either use Red
    Carpet (Ximian's package managing application) or download the RPM
    packages from our FTP site.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please note that the packages are made to work with your existing
    GNOME 2 packages as provided by your distribution; installing this
    preview release will not change your existing setup nor replace
    any of the base packages in your distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, the packages are made to be parallel-installable with
    Evolution 1.2 so you can test Evolution 1.3 but still have the
    old, stable version as a backup.
  </p>

  <h4>Installing through Ximian Red Carpet</h4> 
  <p>
    The binaries can be simply installed from the "Ximian Evolution
    Beta" channel from Red Carpet.  If you don't have Red Carpet
    installed, follow the directions on the <a
    href="http://ximian.com/products/redcarpet/download.html"
    target="Red Carpet Download Page">Red Carpet Download page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    After installing Red Carpet, subscribe to the "Ximian Evolution
    Beta" channel.  If you are new to installing Evolution with Red
    Carpet, follow the instructions on the <a target="Ximian Evolution
    Download Page"
    href="http://www.ximian.com/products/evolution/download.html">Ximian
    Evolution Download page</a>.

    <h4>Installing from FTP</h4> 
    <p>
      All the necessary RPMs can be found at the following location (the
      -devel packages are optional.)
    </p>

    <pre> ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-evolution-beta/</pre>

    <p>
      We request that you download the files using your favorite ftp
      application, rather than using your browser to retrieve them.
      Browsers do not log out of ftp connections, which are limited,
      leading to refused connections and server slowdown.
    </p>


    <p>
      Once you have the files, use the <b>su</b> command to become root:
      <br>
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <table cellpadding="20"  bgcolor="#000000" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <tt><font color="#ffffff">$ su <br> Password: [Enter your root password here]"}
</font></tt>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
	<br>
	Then install the files using the rpm command:
	<br>
    <table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <table cellpadding="20"  bgcolor="#000000" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <tt><font color="#ffffff"># rpm -Uvh *.rpm</font></tt>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>You can then launch Evolution by typing "evolution-1.3" on the
      command-line.
    </p>
    <a name="source"></a>
    <h3>Source</h3> 

    <p>
      The corresponding source RPMs can be downloaded from our ftp site
      (below).  Again, please use an ftp client to download these files.

    </p>
    <pre>  ftp://ftp.ximian.com/pub/ximian-evolution-beta/source/</pre>
    
    <h3>Upgrade Notes</h3> 

    <p>
      Evolution 1.3 can be installed at the same time as Evolution
      1.2.  However, these two versions should never be run at the
      same time.  If you want to switch from using Evolution 1.2 to
      using Evolution 1.3, quit Evolution 1.2, run "killev", then run
      "evolution-1.3".  If you want to switch from using Evolution 1.3
      to using Evolution 1.2, quit Evolution 1.3, run "killall
      evolution-wombat evolution-alarm-notify", then run "evolution".
    </p>
    <p>
      It is highly recommended that you make a backup of your 1.2
      ~/evolution directory before switching to Evolution 1.3 to
      prevent data loss.  If you are using POP mail, please consider
      using the "Leave messages on server" option to prevent your mail
      from being erased on the server after download.  (The option can
      be changed from the "Receiving Options" tab of the account
      editor.)
    </p>
    <p>
      All the data (mail, calendars, contacts) should be visible
      without any problems from both Evolution 1.2 and Evolution 1.3.
      Settings such as mail configuration will be imported from
      Evolution 1.2 the first time you launch Evolution 1.3.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you experience any data interoperability problems between the
      two versions, please report them as bugs.  On the other hand,
      please note that if you run Evolution 1.3, change your
      configuration, and then go back to Evolution 1.2, your changes
      to the configuration will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, the backend code has changed very little in the
      migration from GNOME 1.4 to GNOME 2.0, so you should not be
      risking very much.  :-)
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that Ximian Connector 1.2 will NOT work with
      Evolution 1.3, and that there are not going to be any public
      snapshots of Ximian Connector.
    </p>

    <h3>What Has Changed</h3> 

    <p>
      The plan for Evolution 1.3 is to not add any new major features
      compared to Evolution 1.2.  The aim of the upcoming stable
      release is to just provide the same functionality as Evolution
      1.2, but with better integration with the GNOME 2 desktop, as
      well as to take advantage of the features of the new platform,
      such as better font support.  Of course, a bunch of 1.2 bugs
      have also been fixed during the process of porting Evolution to
      GNOME 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      A major change since version 1.2 is that Evolution 1.3 consists
      of only two processes: the front-end ("evolution-1.3") and the
      calendar/addressbook data backend ("evolution-wombat").  For
      this reason, the old "killev" script is no longer necessary for
      debugging purposes.  If things get stuck, just kill these two
      processes.
    </p>

    <h3>Reporting Bugs</h3> 

    <p>
      The main purpose of this release is, of course, to gather as
      much testing as possible from users.  Your help in testing and
      submitting bugs as you find them is highly appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Evolution 1.3 crashes, please take the time to submit the bug
      using Bug Buddy, trying to fill in as much detail as you can
      regarding the circumstances that lead to the crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, on the other hand, you find a problem in the behavior or the
      appearance of the application, please go to <a
      href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/</a>
      to use our Bugzilla interface to report the bug.
      <p>
	You can also check if your bug has been reported before by
	using the <a
	href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/query.cgi">search
	functionality</a> of Bugzilla.
      </p>

      

      <p>
	Enjoy!<br>

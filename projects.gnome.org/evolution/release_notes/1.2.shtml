<h2>Evolution 1.2 Release Notes</h2>

<p>
Ximian Evolution 1.2 is now available. The next major revision of the
award-winning groupware suite, Evolution 1.2 offers exciting new
features and improvements. 
</p>


<h3>Upgrading: Process and Caveats</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Supported Systems</h4>
<p>
Evolution 1.2 is supported on the following operating systems:
</p>
<ul>
     <li> Red Hat 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3
     <li> Red Hat 8.0 (New!)
     <li> SuSE 8.0 
     <li> SuSE 8.1 (New!)
     <li> Mandrake 8.2
     <li> Mandrake 9.0 (New!)
     <li> Solaris 8 for UltraSPARC
     <li> Yellow Dog Linux 2.2 for PPC
 <!--    <li> Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (Woody) for x86 (New!) -->
 </ul>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Ximian Desktop and Ximian Evolution 1.0.x are not
currently supported for SuSE 8.1, Red Hat 8.0, Mandrake
9.0, and Debian Woody.
</p>


<h4>Upgrading from 1.0.x</h4>

<p>
The format of certain configuration files has changed in this version
of Evolution.  When you start Evolution 1.2 for the first time, it
will automatically migrate your configuration so that it will work as
expected with this version.
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT: After you have installed Evolution 1.2, quit Evolution
and type the command `killev' on the command-line (without quotes)
before launching the new version of Evolution.
</p>

<h3>Significant Changes in 1.2</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>Search Criteria Changes</h4>

<p>
When you specify multiple words in search "contains" criterion,
Evolution will now search the mail messages that contain all the words
specified, in any order.  (The 1.0.x behavior was to look for the
whole string in "subject contains" matches, and matched no messages in
the case of body searches.)
</p>
<p>
This applies to the search bar, the filter rules and the vFolder
rules.  Filter rules and vFolder rules might need to be re-adjusted
after you upgrade to version 1.2.
</p>
<h4>IMAP Folder Name Changes (I18N)</h4>
<p>
If you created any folder names using non-ASCII characters using prior
versions of Evolution, you will find they may not be displayed
properly anymore.  This is because previous versions did not implement
IMAP I18N folder names correctly as specified in RFC 2060.
</p>
<p>
The upgrade script will try to rectify any filters or vFolders using
any such names.  However, as it does not know the character set used
by the server, non ISO-8859-1 (latin-1) characters will not be
properly converted.  You may need to reverify the filter and vFolder
rules in this case.
</p>
<p>
Also note that if such folder names do not display properly that it is
purely cosmetic and may be fixed by renaming the folder(s) in
question.
</p>

<h4>PalmOS Synchronization Changes</h4>

<p>
If you wish to synchronize Evolution 1.2 with a PalmOS device, you
will need to install the additional packages "evolution-pilot" and
"gnome-pilot-applet."
</p>

<h3>New Features in the 1.2 Series</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>General</h4>
<ul>

    <li> The toolbar now includes a "New" dropdown menu/button from which
      you can create messages, appointments, etc. from within any
      folder.

    <li> A new, integrated configuration dialog for all of Evolution is
      now provided.

    <li> When you use the folder selection dialog, you can now jump to a
      folder just by typing its name and hitting Enter (instead of
      using the arrows or the mouse).

    <li> You can now specify your default mail, calendar, tasks and
      contacts folders.  The shortcuts in the shortcut bar will always
      point to the default folder; so for example if you have an IMAP
      account you can specify that the INBOX on the IMAP account is
      default and clicking on the Inbox icon on the shortcut bar will
      take you to the INBOX on the IMAP account.

    <li> Fonts for displaying of HTML mail can now be configured from
      within Evolution (instead of having to use GNOME Control
      Center).

    <li> You can now make Evolution play a sound, beep, or display a
      message when new mail arrives.  It is also possible to trigger
      these actions based on a filter rule.

    <li> The behavior of the search bar has been improved, and the UI has
      been integrated better with the menu bar and the rest of the
      system.

      view settings using the "View" menu.

      folder.

    <li> You now can drop objects (e.g. mail messages, appointments)
      directly to the folders on the shortcut bar (in 1.0.x, you could
      only drop them in the folder folder bar).

</ul>

<h4>Calendar</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Loading speed has been improved.

      folders, and take considerably less space on the disk.

    <p>Once you have installed the Connector, you need to set up access for your Exchange account on both the Exchange server and within Evolution.</p>

    <div class="sect2">
      <h2 class="sect2"><a name="config-server" id="config-server"></a>Exchange Server Settings</h2>

      <p>Check with your system administrator to ensure that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>You have a valid account on the Exchange server.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>You are permitted to access the account with WebDAV. This is the default setting for the Exchange server, so unless your system administrator has specifically turned it off, no changes should be necessary.</p>
        </li>
      </ul><br />
      <br />

      <p>The Ximian website knowledge base, at <a href="http://support.ximian.com" target="_top">support.ximian.com</a>, has additional information about checking to make sure that your Exchange server will accept connections from Ximian Evolution.</p>

      <h2 class="sect2"><a name="config-client" id="config-client"></a>Standard Configuration Tool for Ximian Connector</h2>

      <p>Once you know that your server is ready for you to connect, you are ready to add your Exchange account to Ximian Connector.</p>

      <div class="sect3">
        <h3 class="sect3"><a name="config-easy" id="config-easy"></a>Simple Configuration Tool for Ximian Connector</h3>

        <p>Ximian Connector 1.4 comes with a simple account creation tool for some installations. Other installations will require the standard account tool described in <a href="x3010.html#config-client">the Section called <i>Standard Configuration Tool for Ximian Connector</i></a> below.</p>

        <p>The simple assistant works in the following cases:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>If you receive your license key in Ximian Evolution, the simple assistant will start when you click the license file attachment and choose <b class="guibutton">Open in Ximian Connector</b>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>If you have no accounts configured, and your system administrator has preinstalled a license key file, the simple assistant will start when you start Ximian Evolution. It asks only for the name of your Outlook Web Access server, and your username and password. Ximian Connector will determine the remaining information on its own.</p>
          </li>
        </ul><br />
        <br />

        <p>If the simple account tool does not run automatically, create an account as described below.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sect3">
        <h3 class="sect3"><a name="config-exchange-new-account" id="config-exchange-new-account"></a>Creating a New Exchange Account</h3>

        <p>If you would like to create a new account for your Exchange server, select <b class="guimenu">Tools</b>-&gt;<b class="guimenuitem">Mail Settings</b> from any mail view. Then click the <b class="guibutton">Add</b> button in the accounts list. The account creation assistant will guide you through the process, which is also described in <a href="x169.html">the Section called <i>The First Time you Start Ximian Evolution</i> in the chapter called <i>Getting Started with Ximian Evolution</i></a>. If you're not sure about any of the information you need, just ask your system administrator.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Global Address List/Active Directory: Enter the name of your global catalog server (directory server). This will allow you to use the Global Address List (GAL). Normally, Evolution will fetch a maximum of 500 responses to any query, but you may increase or decrease this number if you wish. A lower number decreases load on the server, and many servers will refuse to return more than 1000 results, no matter how many you ask for.</p>

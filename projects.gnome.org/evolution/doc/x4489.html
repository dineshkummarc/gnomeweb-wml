    <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The <span class="QUOTE">"Document"</span>, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as <span class="QUOTE">"you"</span>.</p>

    <p>A <span class="QUOTE">"Modified Version"</span> of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>

    <p>A <span class="QUOTE">"Secondary Section"</span> is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the <a href="x4489.html#fdl-document">Document</a> that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</p>

    <p>The <span class="QUOTE">"Invariant Sections"</span> are certain <a href="x4489.html#fdl-secondary">Secondary Sections</a> whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the <a href="x4489.html#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this License.</p>

    <p>The <span class="QUOTE">"Cover Texts"</span> are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the <a href="x4489.html#fdl-document">Document</a> is released under this License.</p>

    <p>A <span class="QUOTE">"Transparent"</span> copy of the <a href="x4489.html#fdl-document">Document</a> means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not <span class="QUOTE">"Transparent"</span> is called <span class="QUOTE">"Opaque"</span>.</p>

    <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</p>

    <p>The <span class="QUOTE">"Title Page"</span> means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, <span class="QUOTE">"Title Page"</span> means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

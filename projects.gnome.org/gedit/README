gedit website
=============

The pages are generated at build time processing the .page files with
the layout.xsl stylesheet.

The .page files are just plain xhtml fragments surrounded by the the
<page> tag and they end up verbatim in the main area of the generated
html page.

layout.xsl defines the look of the pages and includes the page template:
header, footer, menus and sidebar.
The "downloads" section of the sidebar is generated by merging info from
the current-release.xml file.

To publish a new version you just need to update current-release.xml.

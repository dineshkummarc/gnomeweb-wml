          <h1>This project is deprecated ...</h1>

          <p>The Gnome Basic project died a death of stagnation many moons ago. However - the great news is that some of the code, and the hackers live on inside <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/">Mono</a>.</p>

          <p>Mono is an exciting project that already far surpasses Gnome Basic, it provides large chunks of .Net including an in-progress VB.Net compiler, and a nicely performing JIT. You can find the latest information on mbas the Mono Basic compiler <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mbas.html">here</a>.</p>

          <h1>This project is dead ...</h1>

          <h3><a name="whatis" id="whatis"></a>What is Gnome Basic?</h3>It is an embryonic attempt to provide VB compatible functionality for the GNOME project, particularly with respect to office (VBA) compatibility.

          <ul>
            <li>What about Macro virii?</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    A total non-issue, gb has been designed from the ground up to
  be as secure as possible, currently the worst DoS is RAM consumption
  but this is hardly serious. The security capabilities will be updated
  as more functionality is introduced.
</pre>
            </li>

            <li>So how do I send a patch then?</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    Please send the result of 'cvs -z3 diff -u' to me, and if
  this is your first patch a brief note saying you have read and agree
  to the terms of docs/LICENSE.
</pre>
            </li>

            <li>Isn't it really difficult / have you considered this aspect?</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    Not really and yes many aspects have been considered others
  we do not wish to consider yet. If you can see some great pit we are
  falling into send a patch. The scale of the project is large but this
  is not scary.
</pre>
            </li>

            <li>I use VB a lot and really want to speed up GB developement, how can I help?</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    If you are an ace VB coder but cannot code in C there is a
  limited role for you. If you feel you wish to learn C pick an item from
  the ( expanding ) TODO, implement it, and send me a patch. However, there 
  is room for a competant VB programmer to expand the regression test 
  suite to exercise all the new features that gb implements. All patches
  welcome.

            <li>Why don't you just translate to Python? Python is great ...</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    It is my opinion that translating to Python will sacrifice
  exporting to VB and will in the long run cause serious compatibility
  problems that are not evidant if you control the interpreter.

    Futhermore, it is possible to have a Python 'backend' if you
  so desire but in reality a total waste of time since the interpreter
  will provide equivilant functionality and the C backend eventualy
  will provide faster functionality.
</pre>
            </li>

            <li>Why is GB written in C?</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    C is a great language for writing low level functionality
  in. For example, Python is written in C, GCC's C++ compiler is written
  in C. C is portable, standardized, lucid and powerful. GB is however
  written in an object oriented fashion using the Gtk Object model.
</pre>
            </li>

            <li>What License is GB under?</li>

            <li style="list-style: none">
              <pre>
    Essentialy GPL for core and LGPL for runtime. Please read
  gb/docs/LICENSE before you contribute code, as we reserve the right
  to switch code between the GPL and the LGPL.
</pre>

              <h3><a name="screenshots" id="screenshots"></a>Screenshots</h3>Just to whet your apetite there is a simple number game test in CVS that so far appears to work quite nicely. Here is a <a href="gnome-basic.jpeg">photograph</a> of it running.

              <p>Here is the fruit of the project work, loading a shed load of <a href="gb-tc-vbp.jpeg">forms</a> at once.</p>

              <h3><a name="lists" id="lists"></a>Mailing lists</h3>The <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gb/">Gnome Basic mailing list</a> can be reached at <a href="mailto:gb@ximian.com">gb@ximian.com</a>. If you want to subscribe to the mailing list please fill out <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gb/">the subscription form</a>. Also if you could please check the <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gb/">Gnome Basic archives</a> for an answer to your question before posting your query it would be greatly appreciated. Please read some <a href="../gnumeric/mailing-list.html">advice</a> before sending mail.

              <p>The project is still in a very pre-alpha stage, hence be kind in your critique. Furthermore any comments of a non technical nature only serve to waste valuable developer time. This list is intended for technical developer discussion, preferably with patches.</p>

              <h3><a name="getting" id="getting"></a>Getting Gnome Basic</h3>As with any other software in GNOME, you can fetch the latest development version of Gnome Basic from the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/SVN">GNOME Anonymous SVN</a> and from the GNOME SVN. Just checkout the module "gb".

              <p>CVS can also be browsed from <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/gb/">http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/gb</a>.</p>

              <p>A tentative preliminary, development release is available at <a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gb/">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gb/</a></p>

              <h3><a name="support" id="support"></a>Contractual Support</h3>If you are interested in contracting support for Gnome Basic, please check the <a href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian Inc.</a> web page.

              <p>All the code written by Ximian is released under the terms of the GNU GPL. If the code extension is general enough your extension might be folded into the main Gnome Basic distribution.</p>

              <h3><a name="bugs" id="bugs"></a>Reporting Bugs</h3>We are very interested in grammar / parser bugs, since these usually point to features we havn't thought about yet, and affect the core design. We are less interested in general bug reports, since development is proceeding apace. Also security bugs are of great interest, please report these. Try to make sure that you have the latest version of gb before reporting a bug since many bugs are silently fixed.

              <p>The standard procedure for bug reporting is detailed at <a href="http://bugs.gnome.org/">http://bugs.gnome.org/</a> please ensure that your bug hasn't already been logged by checking the <a href="http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgb.html">list</a>.</p>

              <p>There are certain types of bug that we are especially interested in. GB should <b>never</b> die (SEGV) if it does please, please put the effort in to submit a bug report, it will save others lots of grief. Also, if you see any gaping security holes, we would be most interested.</p>

#Name: WhatsNew
#Question:
What's new in this version of the FAQ?
#Answer:
Updated for version 0.94, with explanations of problems in rotation,
autorouting, and X-less conversion.

#Group: The Dia interface

#Name: RightMenu
#Question:
How can I do anything but creating and moving objects?
#Answer:
Like <a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="_top">The Gimp</a>, Dia depends heavily on
a menu on the right mouse button inside the diagram.  That menu contains
all the diagram-specific actions and a few other things, so you almost
never have to find the menu on the toolbox.  A <a
href="images/right-mouse-screen.png">snapshot</a> shows an example of the menu.

#Name: DiagramProperties
#Question:
I try to change diagram properties, but nothing happens.
#Answer:
The preferences dialog only affects diagrams that are created thereafter.
To change grid lines etc., go to the View menu and select settings there.
The settings will be saved with the diagram.

#Name: TwoButtonMouse
#Question: I don't have a middle mouse button, what can I do?
#Answer: Unix (XFree86):  If EmulateThirdButton is enabled (which it should
be if you have a two-button mouse), you can make a middle-button click by
pressing both buttons simultaneously (an action also known as chording).
Windows: If you don't have a middle mouse button, hold down the Ctrl key
and use the right mouse button. 

#Name: Accelerators
#Question: How can I set or change an accelerator key for a function in the menu?
#Answer: Highlight the menu item then press the desired key or
key-combination. 
To remove an assigned accelerator key, highlight the menu item then press the delete key.  If you wish to reassign an accelerator key, it is not necessary to delete the current assignment first.  Simply highlight the new menu item and press the key or key-combination.
Notice that as of 0.91 (GTK-2.0), Delete can also be assigned, if no other
key is assigned to that menu item.

#Name: ToolAccelerators
#Question: How can I set or change an accelerator key for one of the icons in the main window?
#Answer: These functions correspond to the items in the Tools menu.  Set or change their accelerator keys there.

#Name: SelectStyles
#Question:
What are the five radio-buttons in the Select menu
for?
#Answer:
They determine what happens when you drag-select objects.  Normally, only
the objects included in the drag area end up selected.  By selecting other
choices in the Select radio menu, you can change that behavior:
<dl>
<dt>Union:
<dd>Both the drag-selected objects and the previously selected objects end up
selected. 
<dt>Intersect:
<dd>The only objects that end up selected are those that were already
selected <em>and</em> were drag-selected.
<dt>Remove:
<dd>Those previously selected objects that are in the drag area become
unselected. 
<dt>Invert:
<dd>The objects in the drag area change selectedness:  Unselected objects
become selected, selected objects become unselected.  The objects outside
the drag area are not affected.
</dl>

These operations correspond to set operations between the previously
selected objects and the drag-selected objects.

#Group: Making diagrams with Dia

#Name: BendsInZigzags
#Question:
How do I add bends to a zig-zag line?
#Answer:
The middle mouse button gives an object-specific menu.  For zig-zag lines,
poly lines and bezier lines, that menu allows you to add and remove bends.
<p>
<img src="images/addbend1.png" valign=top>
<img src="images/addbend2.png" valign=top>
<img src="images/addbend3.png" valign=top>

#Name: HorizontalZigzags
#Question:
How do I make a zig-zag line go horizontally?
#Answer:
As of version 0.93, zig-zag lines support a primitive form of
autorouting that is intended to solve this problem and make it easier
to make the diagrams look good.  The autorouting algorithm does not
attempt to avoid objects, but should at least make the lines go the
right direction out from connection points.  If it doesn't appear to
work, double-click the zig-zag line and check that autorouting is on
for it.  This setting can also be accessed from the object menu.
<p>
For previous versions, here is a workaround for how to make zigzags
change direction:
<p>
Using the object-specific menu on the middle mouse button, create an extra
segment at each end of the line, then delete the middle segment:
<ol>
<li><img src="images/zig1.png">
<li><img src="images/zig2.png">
<li><img src="images/zig3.png">
<li><img src="images/zig4.png">
<li><img src="images/zig5.png">
</ol>

#Name: ResizeClasses
#Question:
Why can't I resize classes etc.?
#Answer:
The size of classes is decided by their contents, especially the text.
Note that you can scale the entire diagram when you print, see the question
about <a href="#FitToPage">page fitting</a>.

#Name: FixedConnectionPoints
#Question: Why do elements have a fixed number of connection points?
#Answer:
We've been thinking about how to allow more connection points.  Point is,
there are several different ways it could be done that all make sense, and
we'd like to get the most usable of them, while maintaining backwards
compatibility.  Note that the standard Line object allows you to add more
connection points to it by the middle mouse menu.  You can in a pinch place
a line along the edge of an object and use the lines connection points:)

#Name: Rotating
#Question:
Why can't Dia rotate arbitrarily?
#Answer:
Neither X nor GTK has built-in support for rotating arbitrary shapes (text,
ellipses etc).  Work is being done on a Display Postscript interface that
will allow arbitrary rotation.  Work is also in progress on <a
href="http://www.freetype.org" target="_top">FreeType</a> support, which would allow for rotation.
<p>
Having rotated text is only part of the problem.  We also need
infrastructure so that handles, connection points, bounding boxes etc
are rotated along with the object.  Help on this would be appreciated.

#Name: AddingConnectionPoints
#Question:
Why can't I add more connection points to objects?
#Answer:
You can, for some objects.  Adding connection points in general is a tricky
problem, as it is difficult to make sure that the points keep their
placement after a reload.  The standard line object allows adding more
points via the object menu.

#Name: FontSupport
#Question:
Why don't the fonts work right?
#Answer:
Font support is not very standard in X, especially when you want to make
images, print, and send the files to other people.  In Dia version 0.90 and
earlier, you can improve things by installing the <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dia-list@lysator.liu.se/msg02705/urw-aliases-0.0-1.noarch.rpm" target="_top">urw-aliases</a>
package (or the GhostScript fonts).
After installing the package, you will need to do a simple edit of a config
file.  Edit <code>/etc/X11/fs/config</code> and move the line
<code>/usr/share/fonts/default/urw-aliases</code> to just below the
<code>...:unscaled</code> lines (make sure the commas are in the correct
places after making the change).  Then run <code>killall -USR1 xfs</code>
to get the font server to reread its config file.  The URW fonts should be
used in place of the adobe ones they are clones of when an unscaled bitmap
version can't be found.
<P>
As of 0.91, Dia on Unix uses the <a
href="http://www.freetype.org" target="_top">FreeType library</a> to provide better font
support.  The fonts for this are in turn controlled by font-config.  Note
that this means that remote fonts servers cannot be used.

#Name: SmallFonts
#Question: The fonts are really unreadably tiny, either on screen or when
writing PNG.
#Answer:
Dia 0.91 assumed things about Pango that weren't guaranteed, but didn't
make a difference at the time.  However, Pango 1.2.4 and up changed so that
Dia's wrong assumptions now cause problems.  This is fixed in Dia 0.92.1.
Alternatively, if you can't install 0.92.1, you can downgrade your Pango to
below 1.2.4.  We highly recommend using the newest version of Dia, though.

In Dia 0.92-0.94, we used a reworked cache which still didn't quite keep
different sizes of the same text apart, so text would change size between
huge, tiny and normal.  In 0.95, the cache is disabled.

#Group: Saving and Printing

#Name: DiaFileFormat
#Question:
What format is the .dia file?
#Answer:
The native Dia file format (extension .dia) is XML compressed with GZip.
You can select not to compress the files in the Preferences or in the save
dialog. 

#Name: FitToPage
#Question:
How can I scale the diagram to fit a page?
#Answer:
In the Page Setup dialog (selected from File/Page Setup), select Fit to:,
and the blue lines will continuously self-adjust to fit to a page (or
several pages).

#Name: UsingPSTricks
#Question: How do I use a exported TeX/PSTricks file in my TeX document?
#Answer:
First add <code>\usepackage{pstricks}</code> to the preamble of your TeX
document.  Then include your image as

<pre>
\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{filename.tex}
\caption{A caption}
\label{figure:alabel}
\end{figure}
</pre>
<p>
in your document.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Up to and including version 0.86, Dia doesn't deal correctly
with some functions that PSTricks doesn't implement.  You may have to
change the start of the generated file to look like this:
Then uncomment the three commands in the generated TeX file
(unless you have a PSTricks with this functionality implemented), so
it looks like:
</p>
<pre>
% PSTricks TeX macro
% Title: x500name.dia
% Creator: Dia v0.86
% CreationDate: Thu Oct  5 11:25:54 2000
% For: a user
% \usepackage{pstricks}
\providecommand{\setlinejoinmode}[1]{}
\providecommand{\setlinecaps}[1]{}
\providecommand{\setfont}[2]{}
...
</pre>

<p>

<b>Note:</b> PSTricks in the tetex-1.0.6-11 RPM (used in Red Hat Linux 6.2)
is buggy.  Easiest fix is to get <a
href="http://www.ctan.org/cgi-bin/CTANfilesearch.pl?FILESTRING=pstricks.texftp://ftp.sunsite.utk.edu/pub/CTAN/graphics/pstricks/generic/pstricks.tex" target="_top"><code>pstricks.tex</code></a>
from <a 
href="http://www.ctan.org/" target="_top">CTAN</a> and put it in
<code>/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pstricks/</code>.
</p>

#Name: PSTricksCoils
#Question: I wish I had nice zigzags and coils as in PSTricks.
How could I get them?
#Answer: Draw them as standard lines in dia. Then in the <code>.tex </code>
file replace <code>\psline</code> by <code>\pccoil</code> or <code>\pczigzag</code>.
For more information on their arguments look into your
PSTricks documentation included in your PSTricks package
or at PSTricks<A
HREF="http://www.tug.org/applications/PSTricks/index.html" target="_top">
home page</A>.
Careful! Lines with more then one segment have to be split
into separate segments when <code>pccoil</code> and <code>pczigzag</code> are used.

#Name: MathInDia
#Question: How do I put (La)TeX formulas on my diagram?
#Answer: Put them as you would put them in TeX, e.g.:
<code> $\delta^{\dagger}_2$</code>. At the moment of writing this FAQ
it is not yet displayed correctly in dia but TeX code
produced should be fine.  The bounding-box of the formula will not be
calculated correctly.

#Name: GnomePrint
#Question:
Why is printing broken?
#Answer:
Dia has several ways to print:  Dia print, Gnome print and Export as
Postscript.  A given compilation of Dia uses either Dia print or Gnome
print.  Dia's support for Gnome print is currently buggy and disabled by
default, but some distributions (Red Hat for one) compile it in anyway.
If you have such a version of Dia installed, you can Export as Postscript
instead of printing, and then print the resulting file.

#Name: NoXConverting
#Question:
How can I use Dia to convert files without running X?
#Answer:

Version 0.94 of Dia should be able to convert files without running
X.  However, a working installation of GTK is required to link the
program, and Pango must be available for text conversion.

<p>
Earlier versions of Dia depend on X for various things, but it is
planned to allow conversions without running X.  In the meanwhile, you
can use Xvbf to simulate an X server with the command:

<pre>
startx "/usr/bin/env DISPLAY=:1 /usr/bin/dia -e $HOME/tmp/foo.png $HOME/tmp/foo.dia" -- /usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb :1 -once -nolisten tcp
</pre>

Thanks to Basile Starynkevitch for this hint.

#Name: ExportFormats
#Question: How do I make Dia use PostScript fonts instead of Pango
rendering?
#Answer:
The current PostScript output on systems with font-config involves
rendering the fonts as bezier curves.  This gives an (almost) perfect output,
but doesn't allow PostScript tools to operate on the fonts.  If you want to
get output using PostScript fonts, use the EPS export filter marked as
"using PostScript Latin-1 fonts".  To use this from the command line for
conversions, add --export-to-format=eps-builtin to the command line.  
<p>
Note that this export doesn't support other encodings than Latin-1,
and the text size may be somewhat off.  Please don't ask us to add
other encodings to this.  We will not do it.  It's an interim solution
while we try to get embedded fonts out of Pango (maybe using
PangoPDF).

#Group: Compiling

#Name: Compiling
#Question:
Why can't I compile Dia?
#Answer:
<p>
In most cases, it is because you have an old version of a support library.
The libraries needed to compile Dia version 0.91+ are:
<ul>
<li><a href="">pkg-config</a> version 0.14.0 or higher.</li>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk+/"

</ul>

Optional libraries that add extra features (for 0.91+):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.sourceforge.net/libpng/" target="_top">libpng</a> (for png export support) </li> 
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-libs/" target="_top">gnome-libs</a> (for Gnome support) </li> 
<li><a href="http://www.artofcode.com/libart.html" target="_top">libart</a>
version 2.1.0 or higher, for antialiasing and PNG export support.</li>

</ul>

The libraries needed to compile Dia as of version 0.90 are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glib/" target="_top">Glib</a>
version 1.2.0+ (required by GTK)</li>

<li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libunicode/"
target="_top">libunicode</a></li> version 0.4 (not the version 0.7
available at SourceForge).
</ul>

Optional libraries that add extra features (for 0.90):

<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.sourceforge.net/libpng/" target="_top">libpng</a> (for png export support) </li> 
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-libs/" target="_top">gnome-libs</a> (for Gnome support) </li>

<li><a href="http://www.artofcode.com/libart.html" target="_top">libart</a>
version 2.1.0 or higher, for antialiasing and PNG export support.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that if you use some package system (<code>dpkg</code> or RPM), you
will need to download the development packages (<code>-dev</code> or
<code>-devel</code>). 

</p>
<p>
Some systems, notably Red Hat and derivatives, don't have
<code>/usr/local/lib</code> in <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code>.  GNU applications by default
install into <code>/usr/local</code> when compiled.  To make Dia work there,
either add <code>/usr/local/lib</code> to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> and run
<code>ldconfig</code> as root, or configure with <code>--prefix=/usr</code> to
put everything in <code>/usr</code>.
</p>
#Name: TarToRPM
#Question:
How can I convert the tar file to an rpm?
#Answer: <code>rpmbuild -ta dia-XXX.tar.gz</code>

#Name: DiaOnMaxOSX
#Question: Can Dia compile on Mac OS X?
#Answer: Yes, on Mac OS X 10.4.2, using fink versions of libtool 1.5.10,
autoconf 2.59, and automake 1.9.4, Daniel Rogers <daniel@phasevelocity.org>
has managed to compile Dia 0.94 under Mac.  See
<a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2005-July/msg00030.html">this
mail</a>.  It has not been reported to compile with any non-X port of Gtk2.

#Name: DieOnWindows
#Question: Why does my copy of Dia for Windows die when I try to load it?
#Answer: Because the HOME environment variable is not set.  Add a line like
this to your <code>autoexec.bat</code> file:
<pre>      set HOME=c:\home</pre>
then restart your computer and make sure <code>c:\home</code> exists. The path should not contain
any spaces and is case-sensitive (<code>c:\Home</code> is not the same as <code>c:\home</code>).
<p>
As of Dia 0.88.1, this problem should no longer happen.

#Name: PostScriptOnWindows
#Question: When printing I get many pages of text starting with: 
%!PS-Adobe-2.0. What to do?
#Answer: Buy a postscript printer or implement GDI printing ... :-)
The other option is to install <A HREF="http://www.ghostscript.com/" target="_top">Ghostscript</A> along with its print redirector
so you can have a Windows printer that filters things through gs.

#Name: MakingPatches
#Question: How do I make patches for Dia so that they are integrated with
minimum delay?
#Answer: Cyrille Chepelov answered this question in depth after yet another
impractical patch had arrived on the list.  To avoid headaches for
everybody, please follow these words of wisdom:
<p>
The best way to generate these is to download the tree through anonymous CVS
(from cvs.gnome.org, this is possible of course also for Windows with the
"Universal Geek user interface device driver" (cygwin)).
<p>
Then, all what is necessary is to do <code>cvs add</code>s (commit will of course not 
be accepted), do a <code>cvs -z3 up -PAd</code> to check that the patch will be as up 
to date as possible, and issue the following command:
<br>
	<code>cvs -z3 diff -Nu 2&gt;/tmp/diff.log | gzip &gt;/tmp/some.patch.gz</code>
<p>
Study diff.log to check that no files have been unnecessarily touched.
zless the patch to check that all changes are accounted for in the ChangeLog
and are justified (one patch per orthogonal set of changes is also
preferred).
<p>
An alternative is to have two copies, one pristine and one work area, of the
same tree, preferably a recent CVS snapshot. Modify all files and test in
the work area; then make distclean in both trees, and in the directory which
contains both trees, do something like :<br>
<code>
   diff -urN dia-pristine dia-workarea &gt;/tmp/some.patch<br>
   grep "^+++" /tmp/some.patch # check that no files have been unnecessarily<br>
			       # touched, added or removed.<br>
   less /tmp/some.patch # check that patch is correct<br>
   gzip /tmp/some.patch <br>
</code>

Again, this is possible even on a (okay, recent) Macintosh.

<p> Send patch. Don't resend the same version of the patch twice on the
list (when replying to yourself with updates...). Keep large patches (>
5-40 kb) for private mails and/or in <a
href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org" target="_top">Bugzilla</a> (URL in the mailing list is of
course welcome; small patches are okay, especially if some discussion on
them is sought).

#Name: MissingObjects
#Question:
After compiling, when I run Dia it fails with the following error:
<pre>
"Couldn't find standard objects when looking for object-libs, exiting..."
</pre>
#Answer:
You're trying to run the Dia executable directly from the source
directories.  Either do <code>make install</code>, or run with the wrapper
script app/run_dia.sh.  That way, Dia will know where to find its objects.

#Group: Extending Dia

#Name: AddingShapes
#Question:
How do I add new shapes/sheets?
#Answer:
An explanation is given in <a href="custom-shapes">doc/custom-shapes</a> in the
source distribution on how the shape format works.  
<p>

However, Dia now also has the capability of exporting a diagram as a shape.
Each collection of shapes (called a sheet) should be kept together in a
subdirectory of <code>~/.dia/shapes</code>, e.g,
<code>~/.dia/shapes/Engines</code>. To make a shape, first design it in Dia.
Then export it into your subdirectory.  Two files will be generated, a
.shape file and a .png file (the icon).  
<p>
From version 0.90 and up, Dia features a Sheets and Objects editor which
will allow you to load the shape into a sheet.  It will also update Dia's
loaded objects on the fly.
<p>
If you still want to do things by hand, update the corresponding
sheet file in <code>~/.dia/sheets</code>, in this case called
<code>Engines.sheet</code>.  Example contents of a sheet file is:

<pre>

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?&gt; &lt;!-- -*- xml -*- --&gt;

&lt;sheet xmlns="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia-sheet-ns"&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Engines&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Mechanical Engines&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;contents&gt;
    &lt;object name="Engines - Gas"&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;A gas engine&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
  &lt;/contents&gt;
&lt;/sheet&gt;
</pre>

Each new object should be added to the sheet by adding an
<code>object</code> section.  Next time you restart Dia, the new objects
should show up in the list of sheets.  

#Group: Compatibility

#Name: VisioFiles
#Question: Can Dia open Visio .vsd files ?
#Answer: No, it can't.  Visio file format
is a completely proprietary and undocumented file format.  So it is
really difficult to write code to read it.  The now-defunct Software Bazaar
offered a bounty of several thousand dollars for reverse-engineering the
Visio format.  We really would like to be able to do so.
<p>
An easier alternative would be to make a Visio plug-in that will allow
conversion.  Other programs have already done this for their proprietary
formats.  If somebody were to make such a script, we could set up a public
server to do conversions.

With Visio 2002, it has become possible to export Visio diagrams as XML.
Microsoft, in their infinite generosity, has even published the <a

With the new XSLT plug-in, it should be only a question of writing a
proper XSLT document to be able to translate.

Ian Redfern is working on <a

the Visio format</a>.  If you have any interest in converting Visio files,
please give him your assistance.

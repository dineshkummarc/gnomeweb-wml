  <p>Welcome to Dia's old homepage. A more dynamic version is available as wiki at <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Dia" target="_top">http://live.gnome.org/Dia</a>
  
  <p>Dia is a gtk+ based diagram creation program released under the GPL license.</p>

  <p>Dia is inspired by the commercial Windows program 'Visio', though more
  geared towards informal diagrams for casual use. It can be used to draw
  many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special objects to
  help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network
  diagrams, and many other diagrams. It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple XML files, using a subset of SVG to draw the shape.</p>

  <p>It can load and save diagrams to a custom XML format (gzipped by
  default, to save space), can export diagrams to a number of formats,
  including EPS, SVG, XFIG, WMF and PNG, and can print diagrams (including ones that span multiple pages).</p>

  <p>I feel Dia is in a state where it can be actively used. Many features are implemented and the code is quite solid and mature. Please try it out and tell me what you think of it. If you find any bugs, please <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=dia" target="_top">report them</a> with <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org" target="_top">Gnome Bugzilla</a>. Check out the code too, <b>you might even want to contribute...</b></p>

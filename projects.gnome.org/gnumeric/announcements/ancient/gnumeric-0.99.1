Gnumeric 0.99.1 aka 'Release Candidate 2' is now available.

	This is a bug fix release.  Many thanks to all the testers.  People
	were obviously in a festive mood and thankfully reported lots of issues
	big and small.  Even better they did it _before_ the release !

	Documentation and translation are seeing steady improvement and the
	application is working smoothly.  We have returned to a state with no
	known crashes, or data corruptions.  Barring new reports this release
	will become 1.0.0 on Sunday Dec 30/2001.

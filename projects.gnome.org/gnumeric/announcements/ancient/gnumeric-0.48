Hello,

   A new version of Gnumeric has been released: 0.48 is out on the FTP
site now.

   This version of gnumeric is pretty impressive.  The Gnumeric
hackers have worked very hard in many areas to improve the
spreadsheet.   

   The major visible feature in this release is the beginning of the
Undo support written by Jody Goldberg.  Jody also did a number of
impressive hacks on this release that are detailed below.

   This version does require gnome-xml 1.8.5 to compile, as a small
problem was found in the previous version that made people's
spreadsheets not load.

* Availability:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnumeric

* New in this release

   * Major visible features

	* Undo/Redo support for some actions.  It is not complete, and
	  you should not assume Gnumeric can undo everything right
	  now, as this will still take some time.  (Jody did the
	  infrastructure, JP, Michael and Morten helped out with some
	  of the commands).

	* Hide/show column/rows support (Jody).

	* Auto-save feature (Jukka)

	* The beginning of an Auto-correct tool (Jukka).

	* Show-formulas support.

   * User interfave improvements

	* Keep cursor visible at all times;  Alt-PgUp, Alt-PgDn
	  support (Jody).

	* Auto-format feature: Now expressions and functions will hint
	  a format to be used as a result, so functions that return
	  dates will hint automatically a date-format; Functions that
	  return percentages will hint percentage format and so on
	  (Morten).

	* Clipboard, selection and border fixes (Jody).

	* Selection redraw speed up, it should no longer feel slugish
	  when you deal with large selectins on the screen (Miguel).

	* Solver got improved (Jukka).

	* Jon has cleaned up and enhanced various of our dialog boxes
	  again. 

   * Internal changes

	* New memory management system for the parser: easier to
	  understand, reuses existing code, less likely to leak
	  memory (Morten).

	* Rewrote the internal dependencies engine, which makes
	  Gnumeric a lot faster now for recomputing and loading
	  (Michael). 

	* Tracked down a few memory leaks in the parser (me).

	* Cleanup Excel export code (Jon).

	* Python plugin update, enables users to invoke Gnumeric
	  functions  (Jon).

	* Handles =+X properly (some Excel functions expect that to be
	  0+X). 

	* Improved Excel Summary import/export (Frank Chulli)

   * Function changes

	* PRODUCT() has been made compatible with Excel at the expense
	  of breaking it.  G_PRODUCT() introduced to fix the error
	  (Morten).
	  
    * Bug fixes:

	* Many bugs were fixed (check bugs.gnome.org for details) and
	  patches accepted form the list.

	* Small ui improvements from Mike Kestner

	* XML IO loading of font sizes works correctly now (Jon).

	* VALUE_BOOL is properly handled in the Guile plugin.

	* XML loading of files fixed (Daniel)

	* Enable internal function names in strings (Martin
	  Sheppard).  

    * Doc fixes

	* Valek and Sergey updated the function descriptions.
	
	* New screenshots for documentation in PNG format (Nick Lamb).

Enjoy,
miguel.

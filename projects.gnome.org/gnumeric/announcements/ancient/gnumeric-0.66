Gnumeric 0.66 aka 'thank you sir may I have another' is now available.

Note to packagers : The Bonobo enabled build is now the default.  You WILL need
	to change your packaging to reflect changes in paths and to add
	Bonobo-1.0x as a depend.

This is a _development_ release.  Although the code is stable, packages will
definitely need work to cope with the switch to Bonobo.  It is possible to
build without Bonobo, and will continue to be possible for the foreseeable
future.

Once the packages are up to date you will want to update to get fixes for
    - text exporting that was accidentally disabled in 0.65
    - array formulas that were also disabled in 0.65

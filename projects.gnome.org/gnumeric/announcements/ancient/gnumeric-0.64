Gnumeric 0.64 aka 'Do the Bartman' is now available.

This is a release candidate for Gnome 1.4 and is therefore aimed at
increased stability and improved functionality for existing features.
Overall look and feel has been enhanced: most immediately, Almer introduced
long-awaited live scrolling to augment the existing delayed
approach.  It does fix one memory problem and makes substantial
improvements to the plugin architecture. Two individuals in
particular will be dramatically affected by the release of
"Mini-Morten," a cute little daughter process from Morten and Chen
(Congratulations!). All the other changes are largely cosmetic
polishing and improved handling of corner cases.

Note to packagers : The version requirement for gnome-xml (libxml1) has increased
                    to 1.8.10

NOTE : Please do not package or submit bug reports for gnumeric-bonobo.  Bonobo
       has been frozen for GNOME 1.4 but has not yet become part of the
       official platform.  It is fairly stable but not yet the default build.

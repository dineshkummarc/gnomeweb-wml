Hello,

   I have released a new version of Gnumeric, pretty much a bug fix
over the Numerically Skillfully Cow release of Gnumeric.

   Thanks to all of you who send me good bug reports, here is a list
of the bugs fixed and improvements:

	- Excel loading code improved again by Michael Meeks.  He also
	  spotted a number of bugs in the code which were fixed.

	- Paste was not properly recomputing formulas pasted.

	- Gnumeric no longer crashes on save.

	- Dependecy computation code got fixed.  Horribly typo was
	  doing all sorts of nonsense ;-)

Fetch it from:

Miguel.

Hello Taxpayers!

   A new version of Gnumeric "Late Taxpayer Cow" 0.24.

   Here are the new features since version 0.23:

* New features:

	* Can do some limited importing of drawings from Excel
	  (Michael Meeks)

	* Can import Excel cell comments (Michael Meeks).

	* New functions:
		EVEN(), FACTDOUBLE(), ODD(), QUOTIENT(),
	        RANDBETWEEN(), LOGINV(), NORMINV(), RSQ(),
		ZTEST() by Jukka-Pekka.

	* Preliminary Array handling by Michael Meeks (we still need
	  to add the parser code, but we need to decode the
	  ultra-badly written Microsoft documentation).

	* Michale implemented the CHOOSE() function.

	* 
	  
* New code not enabled by default nor finished:

	* The beginning of a Solver (Jukka-Pekka)

	* Bonobo component embedding.

	* More work on the function wizard

* Fixes:

	* Pasting cells from X had a little bug that did not paste all
	  of the columns.  Fixed now.

	* Now does a better job at pasting numbers. It will not
	  consider some strings as strings, but as numbers.

	* Warnings fixes for various Excel loading features.

	* Zbigniew Chyla fixed the popup menus for the
	  auto-computations.

* Internal changes:

	* Now Sheet Objects are GtkObjects and can be subclassed to
	  add more types.

	* Reimplemented the Ranges as Arrays (Michael).

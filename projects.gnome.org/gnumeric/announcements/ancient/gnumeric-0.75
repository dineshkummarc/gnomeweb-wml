Gnumeric 0.75 aka 'crash me if you can' is now available.

        This will be the last release before we freeze the ui and user visible
        strings for the translators and documenters.  The bug list is melting
        away and the tree is looking good.  This release fixes a few small bugs
        and improves the usability of several components.  Andreas'
        continuing work to guru-ify dialogs progressed into the Solver, making 
        it much more comfortable.  File size has decreased for exported Excel (XLS)
	files with large style regions.  Most of the code to support validation is
        now in place and will be enabled in the next release.

BUG BOUNTY !!!
        Now is the time to test things.  Try loading the nastiest,
        cruftiest workbook you can find.  As previously mentioned, all known
        crashing bugs/recalc/redraw bugs have been patched, so if you find one
        it will get top priority.  If you find a crash between now and the 1.0
        release I'll buy you a beverage of your choice.

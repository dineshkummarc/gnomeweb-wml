Gnumeric 1.1.18 aka 'Light at the End of the Tunnel' is now available.

    Its been 4 months since we last announced a release, and this one is worth
    the wait.  There's so much in here its hard to know where to start.
    
    At long last a gtk2 based charting engine is in place.  An MS Excel
    importer is tied in, and its ready to test.  Its much better than the
    Gnumeric-1.0.x wrapping of Guppi.  The rest of the features should fall
    into place shortly.
    
    In addition, the text import/export code is getting its long awaited spring
    cleaning.  With the addition of a nice encoding selector, and lot of
    internal improvements,  its now lighter, faster, and more utf8 aware.

    Other highlights include
	- lots of bug squashing in preparation for 1.2
	- Multi-screen support
	- performance tuning
	- more HIGification
	- An initial Hebrew translation and some work on RTL support
    Look at the size of the NEWS log and marvel.

    Please start testing this release and submitting bugs.   I'd like to
    compress the beta cycle as much as possible.  The sooner you report the
    problem the sooner we can fix it.  Our avid QA team dredged up 67 bugs in 3
    days and less than twenty, mostly enhancement requests, remain. 

    NOTE : This will (hopefully) be the last release before feature freeze.
	 The charting engine needs a few more bells before we can lock it down.

    NOTE : release 1.1.17 aka 'less fun than a gal stone' was not announced due
           late breaking bugs, we recommend against using it.

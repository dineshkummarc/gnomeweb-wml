Gnumeric 1.1.10 aka 'Chip the glasses, crack the plates' is now available.

	This release is a combination of lots of new code, and piles and piles
	of bug fixes.  Several long standanding requests finally got fixed up.
	Including support for dynamic dependencies so that things like INDIRECT
	and A1:Offset(..) would get updated correctly, horizontal or vertical
	only frozen panes, and manual recalc mode.

	It also had a couple of silly errors that were discovered just _After_
	release.  So I delayed announcing it until the patches were available.

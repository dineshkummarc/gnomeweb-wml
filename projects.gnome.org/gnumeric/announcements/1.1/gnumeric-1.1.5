Gnumeric 1.1.5 aka 'there is no release #4' is now available.

    Lots of fun tibits in here.  Most noteably, Andreas has been kicking the
    printing system into shape so things now work reasonably well, and should
    be alot more usable than 1.0.x.  Jon Kåre's work has paid of in spades,
    Gnumeric can now be embedded in nautilus and libgnumeric is shaping up
    nicely.

    NOTE : We have disabled building 1.1 using gcc-2.96.  There are a few known
       areas where the compiler shipped with RH/Mandrake was causing numeric
       inaccuracies in gnumeric.  If you don't mind that feel free to manually
       remove the prohibition.

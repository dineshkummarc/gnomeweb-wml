Gnumeric 1.1.9 aka 'Shift reduce conflict' is now available.

    This release should be used with caution.  It is stable, but represents the
    transition between Gnumeric-1.0 reference conventions and newer more
    compatible conventions.  It is known to produce xml that the current
    importer is configured not to parse. Specificly.
	1:3 or A:C
    as short forms for full row/col references.  We can parse and generate
    them, but the importer is configured to use the old parser.

    Now that the scary stuff is out of the way I should mention the new toys.
    There has been lots of parser enhancement to improve compatibility, and
    we've finally added at least partial support for the last of MS Excel's
    magic calculation mechanisms (implicit iteration).  While in there I added
    support for range-sets and the intersection operator.

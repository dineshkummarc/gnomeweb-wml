Gnumeric 1.1.11 aka 'DOH!' is now available.

	This is an emergency release to patch some bone-headed mistakes in
	1.1.10 that made it all but useless (yes I tested it, no I did not test
	quite the right things).

	However, as usual the team has been busy tacking on lots of nifty new
	toys.  Indeed our main problem now a days is getting enough man power
	to do all the things that can be added easily.  The core is in good
	shape and there are piles of features that could be added by a new
	developer.

	Morten has been blazing along ensuring that the numbers are accurate
	and that there are absolutely no leaks.  Team Andreas and Adrian are
	busy polishing the latex exporter and I threw in the basic version of
	an optimisation that puts the zip back in the pango enabled display.
	We even had a few test cases from RH Japan that validate our handling
	of eastern XL.

    NOTE : Although this is a development release it should be quite stable.
      There are is still feature regressions from 1.0 (porting graphs to gtk2)
      but other than that this release should be usable.  Please
      play with it.

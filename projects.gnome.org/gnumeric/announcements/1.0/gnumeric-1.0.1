Gnumeric 1.0.1 is now available.

	This is a bug fix release.  A last minute 'fix' for a translation
	subtlety went horribly wrong causing a crash.  This is a high priority
	patch.

	I'll also take this time to thank the documentation team
	for it valiant efforts to get the manual into shape for the release.
	Sorry to have left you out of the 1.0.0 announcement.

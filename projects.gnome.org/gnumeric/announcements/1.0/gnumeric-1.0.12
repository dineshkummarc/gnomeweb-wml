Gnumeric 1.0.12 'Coochie coo Balder' is now available.

This is a maintenance release. New development is being done in the 1.1.x
series which is based on gnome2.

Probably the most important change is a reversal of the XML importer change
made in 1.0.11 which turned out to cause problems when importing XML files
that contained non-ASCII characters. The original problem that was the
reason for that change is now being worked around in a different fashion.

      <h1>Welcome to Gnumeric!</h1>
      <p>The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the <a
      href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> desktop environment: a
      project to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.</p> 
      <p>The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet.  We are
      not attempting to clone existing applications.  However, Gnumeric
      can read files saved with other spreadsheets and we offer      
      a customizable feel that attempts to minimize the costs 
      of transition.</p>

      <h2>Migration</h2>
      <p>Gnumeric will import your existing Microsoft Excel files.
      Import filters also exist for Lotus 1-2-3, Applix, Sylk, XBase,
      Open Office, Quattro Pro, Dif, Plan Perfect, and Oleo files, but these
      import filters are less complete.  If you have knowledge of these file
      formats or have access to the underlying program,

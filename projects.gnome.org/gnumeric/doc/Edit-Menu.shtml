      The <span class="guimenu">Edit</span> menu is mostly used for operations
      on a worksheet or between worksheets. This menu gives users
      powerful editing operations such as the ability to undo recent
      changes, the ability to cut and paste selections of cells and
      the ability to search for specific cell contents.

	<p class="para block block-first">
	  These menu items allow the user to remove recent changes to
	  a worksheet or re-introduce changes which have been
	  undone. These options give the user control over recent
	  edits. This functionality is often called the "change
	  history" of an application. </p>
	
	<p class="para block">
	  The type of edit has no importance. An edit which deletes
	  the contents of a cell is treated in the same way as an edit
	  which adds contents to a cell. The change history is session
	  specific. The user will not be able to undo changes through
	  the change history if the file is saved and then
	  re-opened. Note also that the list only covers the last few
	  dozen operations. The number of operations which Gnumeric
	  tracks in its history depends on the size and complexity of
	  those operations. Finally, there are some operations which
	  cannot yet be modified in this way in <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> 1.0.
	  Sheet operations (adding or removal)
	  cannot be undone, nor can deleted comments be restored, nor
	  can altered summary information, nor can operations on
	  embedded objects be undone.

	      remove the last few edits from a workbook. The edits
	      must be undone in order. This menu item removes only the
	      last edit from the workbook. The user can also access
	      the undo list through one of the toolbar buttons and its
	      associated menu.  With this menu, the user can undo
	      several operations at once. This is explained in section

	      The menu item only restores the last undone

	      the standard toolbar and through the associated

	These menu items enable selected cell contents to be moved
	around a spreadsheet, moved between worksheets or between
	workbooks. Selections are areas of the spreadsheet that have
	been chosen, usually with the mouse, and are usually colored
	pale blue. Selections are explained in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="sect-data-selections.shtml" title="Selecting Cells and Cell Ranges">Section 5.6 ― Selecting Cells and Cell Ranges</a>.
	<span class="application">Gnumeric</span> currently only allows
	single range selections for these operations.

	<p class="para block">
	  To use these menuitems, the user must first select the range
	  of the cut or copy area. When the user then picks these
	  menuitems, the contents of the selected areas will be
	  entered into the <span class="application">Gnumeric</span>
	  clipboard and into the X clipboard. The
	  contents of the <span class="application">Gnumeric</span>
	  clipboard can then be inserted into a new region of the
	  spreadsheet, into another worksheet or into a new
	  workbook. The X clipboard holds the space delimited results
	  of each cell: either the text or the result of any
	  calculation. The X clipboard can be pasted into any text
	  area.

	      open workbook. When the menu item is chosen, the
	      selected area will be outlined with a moving dotted
	      line. This is the area which will be moved. The

	      <span class="guimenuitem">Copy</span> — The

	      modified by the cell contents. For instance, using the
	      divide operation will result in each cell in the zone
	      pasted into being divided by the equivalent cell which
	      was cut or copied originally.
	    </p>
	    <p class="para block">
	      The final choices allow the transposition of the
	      original selection or to not paste empty cells. The
	      <span class="guilabel">transpose</span> check box will change the
	      selection so that the cells that are down n rows from
	      the selection's origin are pasted as being over n
	      columns (and vice-versa). The <span class="guilabel">skip
	      blanks</span> prevents
	      <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> from taking any
	      action for the cells in the selection that are

	      that option is selected but then that the paste will not
	      change the cells in the transformed location if this

            two ways. One way to start the <span class="interface">Graph
            Guru</span> is to click, with the primary mouse
            button, on the toolbar graph button,
            <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="figures/button-graph.png"></span>. Another way is to select, from the

            first plot in the chart, and its sub-type and style. To
            make a graph with multiple plots, a user should start by
            selecting the first plot; subsequent plots can be added

                The first area, area <span class="guimenu">A</span>, provides
                a list of the plot types. The user can pick one of

                that appropriate entry in the list and clicking the
                primary mouse button. The blue highlight indicates
                which plot type has been chosen. The characteristics

                change depending on what plot type is highlighted in
                area <span class="guimenu">A</span>. The icons provide a way
                to select a sub-type of plot, for example, the icons
                for the column plot type provide the choice between
                plotting columns of each data series side-by-side or
                plotting these columns stacked upon each other.
                These icons may also provide a way to quickly select
                different styles for the plot type, for example the
                icons for the line type provide a choice between
                plotting a simple line or placing markers at the
                points along the line. The sub-type cannot be
                changed in the next panel of the <span class="interface">Graph
                Guru</span> without deleting the plot and
                creating a new one. However, the style choices can
                be altered in the next panel. The meaning of each of

            A graph which has already been created can be modified by
            clicking on the graph with one of the secondary mouse
            buttons in order to invoke the context menu and then
            selecting the <span class="guimenuitem">Properties</span> menu
            entry. This will cause the second panel of the
            <span class="interface">Graph Guru</span> to appear which will
            enable the user to make any desired modifications. The use
            of the context menu was discussed in <a class="xref" href="sect-graphical-overview-contextmenu.shtml" title="Invoking the Context Menu for Graphical Elements">Section 9.1.4 ― Invoking the Context Menu for Graphical Elements</a>.

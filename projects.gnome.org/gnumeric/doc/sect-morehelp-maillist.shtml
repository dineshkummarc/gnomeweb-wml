<p class="para block block-first">
    The <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> project maintains a
    mailing list which is a system by which people can send one email
    which gets distributed to everyone who has signed up to read these
    emails. Please understand that this list is used for serious
    discussions about developing this spreadsheet further. Questions
    from users are generally answered when posted to this list but
    simple questions which are answered in the manual may generate the
    simple answer, "Please read the manual." Also, developers
    volunteer any time they take to answer your questions so please be
    polite.
  </p>
<p class="para block">
    The best way to use this resource is first to read the archives
    for the past few months to see if any of the subjects look similar
    to the issue which interests you. It may be that your question has
    just been asked by someone else and a good answer has been
    posted. To access the archives, use a web browser to go to the
    mailing list web page at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome.org/" title="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</a> and then ...
  </p>
<p class="para block">
    If none of the emails recently posted to the mailing list address
    your issue, if you would like clarification to an earlier answer,
    or if you simply want to thank the developers, you are welcome to
    send an email of your own to the list. This simply requires
    writing an email and sending it to
<div class=" block screen block-indent block-first"><pre class="screen">gnumeric-list@gnome.org
</pre></div>
    and your posting will eventually get sent to everyone who is
    subscribed to the list. Please select the subject of your email
    carefully to make it easy for everyone to see if they are
    interested in reading and possibly answering your message. For
    example, the subject "I need help" may be true but is ineffective;
    a better subject would be "Help needed with statistical
    regression". Please make it easy for others to give you help.
  </p>
<p class="para block">
    After you have sent your email, there may be an initial delay
    while the moderator of the list, a person who acts as editor,
    reviews your email to see if it is relevant to the
    discussion. This step is required to limit the junk email that
    gets sent out to everyone.

     <div class="admonition block note block-first block-indent">
       <p class="para block block-first">
         Very rarely an email might automatically be discarded if it
         appeared to be a mass junk mailing. If, after a few days,
         your email does not appear in the archives and you don't get
         any response, then re-send your email to the list omitting any
         signatures or other material that might appear to be
         commercial solicitation. A simple, text message is the least
         likely to be discarded by these automatic tools.
       </p>
     </div>

    Once your email is sent to everyone on the list, someone may
    answer you. They may choose to answer you directly, to post a
    response to the list, or to do both. In the hours and days after
    posting, you can check to see if you received email and check the
    list archives, as is explained above, to see if someone answered
    there.

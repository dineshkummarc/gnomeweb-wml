                plotting columns of each data series side-by-side or
                plotting these columns stacked upon each other.
                These icons may also provide a way to quickly select
                different styles for the plot type, for example the
                icons for the line type provide a choice between
                plotting a simple line or placing markers at the
                points along the line. The sub-type cannot be
                changed in the next panel of the <span class="interface">Graph
                Guru</span> without deleting the plot and
                creating a new one. However, the style choices can
                be altered in the next panel. The meaning of each of

            enables users to configure the plot. This includes
            determining the values which will actually be plotted,
            adding titles to various components, labels to the data
            series, names to data categories, and changing the

            in <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> graphs and to
            understand the properties which can be changed for each
            component is to work sequentially through all of the
            components while both noting the components which can be
            added, listed in the drop down menu when the
            <span class="guibutton">Add</span> button is pressed, and
            observing the properties of the component which can be

            of all the components presented in the top leftmost area,
            labeled <span class="guimenu">F</span>. Components can be selected

            will also change the properties listed in area

            in front of the name of a component, can be expanded or

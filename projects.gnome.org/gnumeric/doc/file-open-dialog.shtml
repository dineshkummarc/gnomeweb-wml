      Opening a file into a workbook is a relatively simple
      process. The only complications come from using the
      <span class="interface">File Open</span> dialog to find the desired
      file, from changing the automatic file format type recognition
      system, or from specifying a different character encoding than
      that chosen by <span class="application">Gnumeric</span>. The first of these steps will become
      intuitive once the user understands the functioning of the
      dialog. The latter two steps are generally unnecessary and can
      be ignored by most users.

        <p class="para block block-first">
	  In order to understand how to change folders, it is first
	  necessary to understand the system by which documents are
	  stored. This system is called the 'filesystem'.
	</p>

	<p class="para block">
	  All documents are stored in a folder. Folders can contain
	  files but can also contain other folders. Any folder
	  therefore can contain several sub-folders, each of which may
	  itself contain several sub-folders; the resulting structure
	  is called a nested 'tree' with the original folder being the
	  'relative root' of that tree.
        </p>

	<p class="para block">
	  In GNU and UNIX systems, all of the files are stored in
	  folders organized in a single, unified filesystem tree with
	  a folder named '<span class="filename">/</span>' at the absolute root
	  of the tree. Every file is accessible from this absolute
	  root folder and, by default, this folder is provided as the
	  choice named <span class="filename">Filesystem</span> with an icon of
	  a disk drive in area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">A</span> in
	  the <span class="interface">File Open</span> dialog.
	</p>

	<p class="para block">
	  Navigating the directory tree from the single root folder
	  would quickly become burdensome and the <span class="interface">File
	  Open</span> dialog provides several other starting
	  folders in area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">A</span>. Two
	  starting folders which are commonly provided are the 'Home'
	  and 'Desktop' folders for the current user.
	</p>

	<p class="para block">
	  In a complex computer system, the absolute root folder may
	  be hidden from the user and the starting folders accessible
	  to the user may only provide limited access to the
	  filesystem. Jointly, the starting folders provided should
	  allow the users to access all the folders in which the user
	  has permission to store files and to the folders which are
	  designed to be read by the user.
	</p>

	<p class="para block">
	  Several starting folders may be provided when files can be
	  opened from different filesystems. This will be the case
	  when filesystem on other machines are accessible over a
	  network or when <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> is running on operating systems whose
	  filesystems are not unified, such as the proprietary
	  operating systems sold by Microsoft in which each disk drive
	  has its own root named, for example,
	  <span class="filename">C:\</span> or <span class="filename">D:\</span>.
	</p>
	  
	<p class="para block">
	  Additional starting folders can be added as 'bookmark
	  folders' by the users themselves. These bookmark folders do
	  not provide access to a different set of folders but merely
	  provide efficient access to a folder and its
	  sub-folders. These bookmark folders are easy to change to
	  allow a user to work efficiently. These bookmark folders are
	  listed, in area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">A</span>, under
	  the thin horizontal separator line. The creation and

		  A character encoding is a system to relate the
	          binary digits contained in a computer file to the
	          characters of a textual script. All computer files
	          consist only of binary digits so some system is
	          required to determine this relationship. Where early
	          computers used simple encoding systems which only
	          supported the characters commonly used in English,
	          most systems are now standardizing on the UTF-8
	          encoding scheme which relates the binary digits in
	          computer files to characters defined in the
	          Universal Character Set, a set which is still being
	          defined but will include all the characters in every
	          language and many other useful symbols for
	          mathematics, science, music and literature.  <a class="xref" href="sect-file-textImport-complex.shtml#sect-file-textImport-complex-encoding" title="Character Encodings">Section 14.4.1.1 ― Character Encodings</a>

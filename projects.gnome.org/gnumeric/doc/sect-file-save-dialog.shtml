      Saving a workbook to a file can be a simple process, depending
      on the folder in which the file is to be saved. If this folder
      is in the predefined list of standard folders and user bookmark
      folders, the file can be created with the compact
      <span class="interface">File Save</span> dialog. The components of the
      compact <span class="interface">File Save</span> dialog and the
      procedure to save a workbook to a file in the predefined list of

      However, when the workbook is to be saved to a file created in a

	<p class="para block">
	  All documents are stored in a folder. Folders can contain
	  files but can also contain other folders. Any folder
	  therefore can contain several sub-folders, each of which may
	  itself contain several sub-folders; the resulting structure
	  is called a nested 'tree' with the original folder being the
	  'relative root' of that tree.
        </p>

	<p class="para block">
	  In GNU and UNIX systems, all of the files are stored in
	  folders organized in a single, unified filesystem tree with
	  a folder named '<span class="filename">/</span>' at the absolute root
	  of the tree. Every file is accessible from this absolute
	  root folder and, by default, this folder is provided as the
	  choice named <span class="filename">Filesystem</span> with an icon of

	  will be called, in this documentation, the 'relative root'
	  folders since each of these will act as the root of the
	  branching structure of sub-folders the relative root folder

        Often the user wishes to save the <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> workbook by creating
        a file in a folder which does not yet exist. A new folder can

        <span class="keysym">Enter</span> key, depending on the keyboard) will
        change the folder name and open that folder. Area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">I</span> will therefore be empty since the

        mouse button, moving the mouse pointer to area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">F</span> and releasing the mouse button. As
        the mouse pointer is moved from area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">I</span> to area <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">F</span>, a small icon of the folder will move
        with the mouse pointer.

2005-12-30  Olav Vitters  <olav@bkor.dhs.org>

2005-04-10  Olav Vitters <olav@bkor.dhs.org>

	* maintainers.html: Maintainers and QA addresses end with @gnome.bugs.

	* ./triage/product-specific.html: GNOME1.x has been replaced with
	OBSOLETE.

2005-04-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* triage/stock-responses.html
	* triage/stock-responses.txt:
	Make it more clear in duplicate response that when maintainers are
	looking for more information that they need it for fixing the bug.
	Hopefully this will get more people to respond.

2005-03-28  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* triage/stock-responses.html
	* triage/stock-responses.txt:
	various cleanups, big one being that the getting traces guide has
	moved to http://live.gnome.org/GettingTraces (though the old link
	exists as a redirect)

2005-02-01  Alex Duggan  <aldug@astrolinux.com>

	* triage/non-gnome.html: Update freedesktop bugzilla

2005-01-07  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/stock-responses.html
	* triage/stock-responses.txt: stop referencing galeon

2005-01-02  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* statistics/Makefile: For some strange reason, perms were being
	set wrong on files.  Attempt to fix that.

2005-01-02  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* Makefile: 
	* tree.in:

	New stuff

2004-12-29  Elijah Newren  <newren@gmail.com>

	* triage/product-specific.html: add information about gDesklets
	(yeah, I guess that means we're not restricted to core gnome
	applications, though it might be nice to split out these into
	separate groups)

2004-11-09  Caleb Groom <caleb@calebgroom.com>

	* content/projects/bugsquad/triage/finding-bugs.html: Removed bugsquad
	keyword from the unconfirmed bug search.

2004-11-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	*sigh*  We have made lots of changes to bugzilla

	* triage/examples/needs-patch-keyword-nautilus/*: PATCH keyword
	isn't used anymore, bugsquad keyword doesn't exist, and
	"Unversioned Enhancement" is used as a Gnome Version when there
	was no equivalent with GNOMEVER* keywords

	There are certainly many similar changes to be made to the other
	examples--this was just the first in the list.

	* triage/examples/needinfo-crash/gnome-chess/bug-111769-after.html:
	This is an example of marking a bug as needinfo; while close can
	also be done later, I don't want to cover that yet.

2004-11-07  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	Update all the examples.  All these changes were submitted by Rob
	Sharp <rob@quannum.co.uk>.  Thanks Rob!

	* triage/examples/<just about everything>: Update these to reflect
	the bugzilla upgrade

2004-10-27  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/stock-responses.html: } GNOME TWO
	* triage/stock-responses.txt:  } POINT EIGHT!

2004-10-27  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/product-specific.html: add a note for finding libwnck
	duplicates; flesh out the one for metacity

2004-10-25  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/product-specific.html: patch from Vincent Noel for gpdf

2004-09-27  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* maintainers.html: Change the bits about -maint aliases to remove
	all references to halloween.

2004-08-16  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/Makefile: We want the same decoration for
	product-specific.html as for other files (header, sidebar, and
	footer)

	* triage/main.in: Reduce verbosity and link to stock responses
	inline.
	
	* triage/non-gnome.html: Add revelation, as per request on IRC
	from vidar_
	
	* triage/product-specific.html: Various cleanups
	
	* triage/steps.html: Add extra references to the stock responses,
	and mention the product-specific guidelines.
	
	* triage/stock-responses.html: Make sure all the <a name=...>
	thingys have unique identifiers
	
	* triage/tree.in: Add the product-specific guidelines

2004-08-16  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/product-specific.html: New file containing product
	specific triaging guidelines.  Currently an orphaned page since I
	want to make some changes and verify that things like telling
	maintainers they are allowed to commit changes to this page are
	okay before everyone starts using it.  (Thanks to Chris Davidson
	and Richie Wentzel and for gathering all the information on this
	page)

	* triage/Makefile: add product-specific.html to the list of files.

2004-08-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/steps.html: More updates due to the bugzilla upgrade
	(GNOME Version vs. GNOMEVER keywords, PATCH keyword is being
	deprecated), and clarify things where people commonly make
	mistakes or tend to ask questions (what if they can't find
	anything to change, there are non-gnome products outside the list
	we keep, unknown@b.g.o. doesn't imply invalid email address for
	bug-buddy imported bugs, and reassigning products)

2004-08-13  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* maintainers.html: Clarify the -maint aliases section (it was not
	clear that two different methods were being described), add a
	little more detail about adding a project to the bugzilla
	database, make a note of the release team for_maintainers page,
	and since the changes were affecting most the page anyway (I might
	get flamed for this) make the HTML file actually be readable.

2004-08-02  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/non-gnome.html: Add link for correct location to file
	OpenOffice.org bugs.  Patch contributed by Justin Wake.  (bug
	148502)

2004-07-16  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

	/me smacks himself for not using the Changelog when previously
	updating this guide

	Also, better late than never:
	* triage/stock-responses.html: } GNOME TWO
	* triage/stock-responses.txt:  } POINT SIX!

2004-01-15  Elijah Newren  <newren@math.utah.edu>

        * quick-links.html, triage/main.in, triage/faq.html: small fixes

2004-01-04  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

2003-10-14  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/steps.html: s/2.\3/2\.5/

2003-09-25  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/faq.html: fixed my HTML, changed the answer about
	closing bugs due to not being able to reproduce

2003-09-25  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/faq.html: added a FAQ about unknown@b.g.o

2003-09-15  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/stock-responses.html: } GNOME TWO
	* triage/stock-responses.txt:  } POINT FOUR!

2003-09-01  Elijah Newren <newren@math.utah.edu>

	* triage/steps.html: Added info about GNOMEVER2.4 and GNOMEVER2.5.
	     This really should be cleaned up though--the wording for
	     GNOMEVER2.0 through GNOMEVER2.4 is identical.  But I'm too
	     lazy to do that right now.

2003-07-06  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* Makefile: add quick-links.html
	* main.in: newer version (fuzz)
	* quick-links.html: add

2003-07-06  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* most files: over the past few days, just about everything has been
	upgraded to Elijah Newren's new triage guide. Rock on, fuzz!

2003-06-05  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>
	* new-product-request.html: remove, and all references, since there's
	no way of making people look there first anyway :-)

2003-05-07  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* triage/steps.html: added very little more blurb about GNOMEVER2.3

2003-03-19  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* tree.in: added new-product-request.html. "Maintainer information"
	as a title sucks, but I can't think of anything sufficiently
	short that makes sense.

2003-03-10  Andrew Sobala  <aes@gnome.org>

	* bugtable.html: revert gedit-qa-maint back to Luis, because I'm lame

	<h2>Distribution Issues</h2>
	<p>If you're using a Linux distribution, it's best to file bugs with their bug trackers first. This usually trickles down to the underlying project or may have already been fixed or reported for the distribution but not released yet.</p>

	<h2>Upstream Bugs &amp; Features</h2>
	<p>If your distribution suggests filing a bug upstream, you can do so using the <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=NetworkManager">NetworkManager bugzilla</a>. For questions or queries about this, contact the maintainers on IRC (#nm on freenode) or the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list">mailing list</a>.</p>

	<h2>Professional Support</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager is a volunteer-run project, but if you want a larger feature, hardware enablement, or a bug fix more quickly than the volunteer upstream developers can provide it, then the consulting options on this page are available.</p>

	<h3><a name="HardwareIntegration">Hardware Integration</a></h3>
	<p>With changes happening all the time in hardware, NetworkManager and ModemManager are constantly adapting to the requests for newer and richer technology and features. One great example of this is 2G, 3G and now 4G. Businesses invested in NetworkManager and ModemManager have been at the forefront of implementing this hardware support and working with other projects up and down the Linux stack to make that happen.</p>

	<h3><a name="Porting">Porting</a></h3>
	<p>Porting can cover a range of areas. Perhaps you need help porting NetworkManager/ModemManager to a Linux platform which is lacking support. Or perhaps you have a driver for another operating system but need help porting it to Linux to enable your hardware?</p>

	<h3><a name="BackFolding">Patch Set Back-Folding</a></h3>
	<p>It&apos;s not uncommon for companies to start forking a project to customize it and perhaps to keep it in-house. This can lead to wanting new features from an upstream project like NetworkManager being available in your forked version. If you need help back-folding patch sets into upstream or suggesting new features into the main stream, we have a support network that can help you do that.</p>

	<h3><a name="Training">Training</a></h3>
	<p>There are various training opportunities on offer. Everything from writing an application with NetworkManager to developing and customizing NetworkManager or ModemManager. If this is what you&apos;re looking for, there are businesses out there that can help you do that.</p>

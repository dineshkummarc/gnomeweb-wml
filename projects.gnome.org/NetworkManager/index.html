	<h2>Pain-Free Networking</h2>
	<p>Networking on Linux can be painful, especially in comparison to other operating systems. You should never need to use the command line or configuration files to manage your network (<i>unless you want to!</i>); everything should "Just Work" as automatically as possible and never stop you from doing what you want to do.  NetworkManager attempts to make networking as invisible as you want it to be.  Whether at home, work, or on the move, NetworkManager automatically connects to the last network you told it to connect to.  From wired to wireless to mobile broadband to Bluetooth, NetworkManager has you covered.</p>

	<h2>Flexible, Extendable, Open</h2>
	<p>The most important pieces of NetworkManager are user-interface and distribution agnostic, functioning just as well in Gnome, KDE, Xfce, embedded devices, etc., and across distributions like Fedora Core, Ubuntu, SuSE, Debian, Gentoo, and others.  And since the NetworkManager components communicate with each other using <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus">dbus</a>, it's easy to to build network-aware applications with languages like <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/examples">C, C++, and Python</a>, or network-aware scripts in your favorite shell.</p>

	<h2>Application Integration</h2>
	<p>Using the awesome power and flexibility of <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus">dbus</a>, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html">udev</a>, and <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ModemManager/ModemManager/">ModemManager</a>, NetworkManager provides facilities for other applications like browsers, email clients, or system services to be aware of the network's state and adjust their operation accordingly.  If you're not online or on your metered mobile broadband connection, your computer probably shouldn't try to update itself.  With NetworkManager, software knows where it is and how it's connected.</p>

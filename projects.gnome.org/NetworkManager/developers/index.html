	<h2>So you want to talk to NetworkManager?</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager provides a detailed and capable D-Bus interface on the system bus.  You can use this interface to query NetworkManager about the overall state of the network and details of network devices like current IP addresses or DHCP options, and to activate and deactivate network connections.  A network connection is a bundle of settings that describe a connection to a particular computer network, like a specific mobile broadband provider or a single wifi network.  These connections are provided by other D-Bus services, called "settings services", which also provide a D-Bus interface and allow you to query and change stored network connections and preferences.  The <a href="spec.html">NetworkManager D-Bus API specification</a> provides a detailed description of each object and interface that NetworkManager provides.</p>

	<h2>Or you want to hack on NetworkManager?</h2>
	<p>First, you should probably consider joining the mailing list as there is a lot of useful information there from other NM hackers: <a 
href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list">http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list</a>.</p>
	<p>Second, read the <a href="design_goals.html">Design Goals</a> of NetworkManager to get an idea of why things work the way they do.</p>
	<p>To checkout and build the latest, hottest sources of the core NetworkManager daemon from git:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.git</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd NetworkManager</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>And if you want to play with the applet, you need network-manager-applet, too, this time from SVN:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>svn co svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/network-manager-applet/trunk network-manager-applet</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd NetworkManager</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>There are also VPN service plugins for vpnc, openvpn, and pptp.  Each has its own SVN module, so replace 'vpnc' as appropriate in the following example:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>svn co svn://svn.gnome.org/svn/network-manager-vpnc/trunk network-manager-vpnc</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd network-manager-vpnc</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>

	<h2>Actually hacking on it</h2>
	<p>If you make changes to NetworkManager, create the patch using a Unified diff format (ie, diff -u) and mail the patch to the NetworkManager list.  Others on the list may make suggestions, please take these into consideration.  Eventually, your patch can be checked into NetworkManager SVN.</p>

	<h2>Stuff to work on</h2>
	<p>The most up-to-date list of work items is kept at the live.gnome.org Wiki <a href="http://live.gnome.org/NetworkManagerToDo">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>So you want to talk to NetworkManager?</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager provides a detailed and capable D-Bus interface on the
	system bus.  You can use this interface to query NetworkManager about
	the overall state of the network and details of network devices like
	current IP addresses or DHCP options, and to activate and deactivate
	network connections.  A network connection is a bundle of settings that
	describe a connection to a particular computer network, like a specific
	mobile broadband provider or a single wifi network.  These connections
	are provided by other D-Bus services, called "settings services", which
	also provide a D-Bus interface and allow you to query and change stored
	network connections and preferences.  The NetworkManager D-Bus API
	specification (<a href="api/07/spec-07.html">[0.7]</a>
	<a href="api/08/spec-08.html">[0.8]</a>
	<a href="api/09/spec.html">[0.9]</a>) provides a detailed description
	of each object and interface that NetworkManager provides.</p>

	<h2>Migrating to NetworkManager 0.9</h2>
	<p>The 0.9 release is a significant milestone, and provides more simplified
	D-Bus interface that makes it easier to write user applications that take
	full advantage of the networking state.  That means quite a few things have
	changed.  To help smooth the process of updating applications, check out
	the <a href="api/09/ref-migrating.html">0.9 Migration Guide</a>.  Let us
	know if you have tips, suggestions, problems!</p>

	<h2>Using the GLib API</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager also provides two glib-based convenience libraries
	called libnm-util and libnm-glib.  These wrap the D-Bus interface in
	easy-to-use GObjects.  Documentation for libnm-util is here: 
	<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/libnm-util/08/">[libnm-util 08]</a>
	<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/libnm-util/09/">[libnm-util 09]</a>
	and documentation for libnm-glib is here:
	<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/libnm-glib/08/">[libnm-glib 08]</a>
	<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/developers/libnm-glib/09/">[libnm-glib 09]</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Show me some examples!</h2>
	<p>Sure, there's a bunch of examples for Python, C, and glib, and Qt
	right here: <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/examples">[09]</a>
	<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/examples?h=NM_0_8">[08]</a>.</p>

	<h2>Or you want to hack on NetworkManager?</h2>
	<p>First, you should probably consider joining the mailing list as
	there is a lot of useful information there from other NM hackers:
	<a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list">http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list</a>.</p>
	<p>Second, read the <a href="design_goals.html">Design Goals</a> of
	NetworkManager to get an idea of why things work the way they do, and
	check <a href="http://live.gnome.org/NetworkManager">out the wiki</a>
	for more information on the architecture.</p>

	<p>To checkout and build the latest, hottest sources of the core NetworkManager daemon from git:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.git</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd NetworkManager</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>The development branch of NetworkManager uses ModemManager to control 3G modems now, so you'll also want to:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/ModemManager/ModemManager.git</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd ModemManager</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>And if you want to play with the applet, you need network-manager-applet, too, this time from Gnome git:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>git clone git://git.gnome.org/network-manager-applet</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd network-manager-applet</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>
	<p>There are also VPN service plugins for vpnc, openvpn, and pptp.  Each
	has its own git module, so replace 'vpnc' as appropriate in the following
	example:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>git clone git://git.gnome.org/network-manager-vpnc</kbd><br>
		<kbd>cd network-manager-vpnc</kbd><br/>
		<kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br>
		<kbd>make</kbd><br>
		<kbd>sudo make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>

	<h2>Actually hacking on it</h2>
	<p>If you make changes to NetworkManager, create the patch using a
	Unified diff format (ie, diff -u) and mail the patch to the NetworkManager
	list.  Others on the list may make suggestions, please take these into
	consideration.  Eventually, your patch can be checked into the
	NetworkManager git source repositories.</p>

	<h2>Stuff to work on</h2>
	<p>The most up-to-date list of work items is kept in the
	<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/TODO">TODO file in NetworkManager git</a>.
	If you see anything you'd like to work on, please send a patch!</p>

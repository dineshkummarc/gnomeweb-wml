	<h1>GARNOME Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

	<div class="deprecated">
	    <p>GARNOME is no more maintained, so users are encouraged to switch to <a
		href="http://live.gnome.org/Jhbuild">Jhbuild</a> now.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>1. General Information</h2>

	<h3>1.1 Can I install GARNOME without breaking my current GNOME setup?</h3>

	<p>Sure, that's part of what GARNOME is for! By default, it will
	  install to <em>~/garnome/</em> and not effect any of your existing GNOME
	  packages. It may affect your configuration files though, so you
	  ought to back them up or use a totally different user to run
	  GARNOME.  <em>(Paul Drain)</em></p>

	<h3>1.2 Can I install GARNOME over the top of my existing GNOME setup?</h3>

	<p>You could, but you <strong>shouldn't!</strong> <em>(and we won't support you if you do)</em></p>
	
	<p>GARNOME isn't a package based setup, it installs from GNOME tarballs
	  with patches. If you install GARNOME into /usr (for example), you will
	  overwrite your system setup with the software we provide.</p>
	
	<p>All of your configuration will be overwritten, all of your settings
	  could vanish, all of the development libraries will be installed and
	  you will destroy any knowledge your packaging software (RPM, dpkg, etc)
	  has about your setup.</p>

	<a name="2"></a>

	<h2>2. Pre-Installation</h2>

	<h3>2.1 How long does GARNOME take to build?</h3>

	<p>That really depends on your system configuration. On a Celeron 666Mhz with
	  128M of RAM, building the basic GARNOME install takes about 7 hours, whereas
	  the same build only takes 30-45 minutes on a Dual Xeon based Intel System.</p>

	<h3>2.2 How much space does GARNOME require to build?</h3>

	<p>On an x86 system, GARNOME 2.12.0 (desktop category and its dependencies)
	  requires 1.75GB as build space (plus an additional 1GB if you are
	  building bootstrap/), however it only occupies around 600MB once installed.</p>

	<h3>2.3 Can I download all the GARNOME components at once?</h3>

	<p>Yes, Open the <tt>gar.conf.mk</tt> file in the main GARNOME directory and
	  look for the <strong>GARCHIVEDIR</strong> line -- uncomment it and
	  specify a directory that you have write permissions to.</p>

	<p>If you type:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		make garchive
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>From your base GARNOME directory (eg. <em>garnome-2.12.0/</em>), the installer
	  will attempt to download all of the packages required to build a complete desktop
	  installation</p>

	<h3>2.4 Can I optimize my GARNOME build?</h3>

	<p>Open the <tt>gar.conf.mk</tt> file in the main GARNOME directory and
	  look for the <strong>CC</strong>, <strong>CXX</strong> and <strong>CFLAGS</strong> 
	  lines -- uncomment these and specify the flags that you need.</p>
	
	<p><em>note:</em> the best way to get a set of <strong>CFLAGS</strong> that will 
	  work with your configuration is to use the 
	  <a href="http://members.jcom.home.ne.jp/jacobi/linux/softwares.html">cpucaps</a>
	  program from the prompt, you should see a line that says:</p>
	
	<p><em>"Recommended gcc (version) target"</em></p>
	
	<p>Uncomment and replace the <strong>CFLAGS</strong> line with the suggestions 
	  from that line and restart your GARNOME build.</p>

	<h3>2.5 Can I speed up my GARNOME build?</h3>

	<p>Yes, you can use <em>ccache</em> to speed up your GARNOME builds, although 
	  this procedure requires <em>additional</em> disc space in your GARNOME build 
	  directory.</p>

	<p>Using ccache is a three step task, first you need to install 
	  <tt>bootstrap/ccache</tt>, then set your cache sizes, then configure your 
	  <tt>gar.conf.mk</tt> file to use the cache.</p>

	<p>GARNOME will require a different size cache depending on what parts of it you 
	  choose to build. However, for best results -- setting your cache size to 
	  <strong>2GB</strong> by typing:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		ccache -M 2G	
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>Will be sufficently large to build all of the standard platform/ and desktop/ 
	  garballs.</p>

	<p>Once you have installed the software and set your cache size correctly, open the 
	  <tt>gar.conf.mk</tt> file in the main GARNOME directory and uncomment the lines 
	  relating to building with <em>ccache</em>.</p>

	<p><strong>note:</strong> If you are building <tt>bootstrap/firefox</tt>, we 
	  recommend you make your cache size to <strong>3GB</strong> -- otherwise, your cache may 
	  resize itself during the build, which may evict some of the more important components 
	  of your cache, slowing your build down.</p>

	<a name="3"></a>

	<h2>3. Installation</h2>

	<h3>3.1 GARNOME always says the downloaded files have bad checksums, are my tarballs broken?</h3>

	<p>Are you using the GNU MD5 tools? Some earlier versions the Sun md5sum tool don't 
	  agree with the GARNOME generated checksums.</p>

	<p>If you are not using a GNU based system, you can open your <tt>gar.conf.mk</tt> file
	  and edit the <strong>MD5</strong> variable to point to a more appropriate binary.</p>

	<h3>3.2 GARNOME has issues with Explicit Congestion Notification Support</h3>

	<p>You may find that some packages will not download for third-party sites
	  (<em>bootstrap/docbook-xml</em>, <em>fifth-toe/bluefish</em>, etc).</p>

	<p>These sites are affected by the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
	  code that is present in a number of operating system kernels. The most frequently
	  reported symptom of this issue is that package downloads will time out after 30 
	  attempts and halt your build.</p>

	<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a GARNOME bug, and should not be reported as such.</p>

	<p>The easiest workaround to this issue, is to temporarily disable ECN support in your
	  kernel. If you have root priviledges on your machine, you can type:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>Then you can resume your GARNOME build and things should proceed normally.</p>

	<h3>3.3 What is the <tt>bootstrap</tt> directory for?</h3>

	<p>The <tt>bootstrap</tt> directory stores meta-information for programs you <em>may</em>
	  need to get a current version of GARNOME up and running correctly, including build tools
	  (like the autotools set), libraries, a <em>recommended</em> version of Mozilla and various
	  platform dependant utilities.</p>

	<p>Most users will <strong>never</strong> need to build anything from the <tt>bootstrap</tt>
	  directory, however you should consult the README file in your GARNOME distribution just to
	  make sure.</p>

	<h3>3.4 GARNOME fails with an error in <tt>bootstrap/dlcompat</tt>?</h3>
	
	<p>If you are not trying to compile GARNOME on an Apple system, and get an error similar to the following:</p>
	
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  checking mach-o/dyld.h usability... no 
	  checking mach-o/dyld.h presence... no 
	  checking for mach-o/dyld.h... no 

	  configure: error: No dyld.h found, can not continue
	  make[1]: *** [configure-work/main.d/dlcompat-20030629/configure] Error 1
	</blockquote>
      </p>
	
	<p>You are trying to compile <tt>bootstrap/dlcompat</tt> when you shouldn't be.</p>
	
	<p>See the question regarding the <tt>bootstrap</tt> directory and it's uses, then restart your compile from the <strong>desktop</strong> directory, as 
	  suggested in the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a>.</p>

	<h3>3.5 GARNOME fails with an error in <tt>platform/glib</tt>?</h3>

	<p>If you are trying to compile GARNOME on an Linux or BSD system, and get an error similar to the following:</p>
	
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  gconvert.c:47:2: #error GNU libiconv not in use but included iconv.h 
	  is from libiconv
	</blockquote>
      </p>

	<p>You have tried to compile <tt>bootstrap/libiconv</tt> when you shouldn't have.</p>

	<p>To fix this problem, you will either need to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>remove the <dfn="the hash character">comment</dfn> from the <tt>--with-libiconv</tt> portion of <strong>CONFIGURE_ARGS</strong> in the platform/glib Makefile.</li>
	  <li>remove the <tt>iconv.h</tt> file from your system prefix
	</ul>
	
	<p>Then restart your GARNOME build.</p>
	
	<p>See the question regarding the <tt>bootstrap</tt> directory and it's uses, then restart your compile from the <strong>desktop</strong> directory, as 
	  suggested in the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a>.</p>

	<h3>3.6 GARNOME fails with an error in <tt>desktop/gnome-doc-utils</tt>?</h3>

	<p>If you are trying to compile GARNOME on an Linux or BSD system, and get an error similar to the following:</p>
	
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  xsltproc: Content HTTP/1.0 200 OK
	</blockquote>
      </p>

	<p>Please see the answer to Question 3.2</p>

	<h3>3.7 GARNOME fails with an error in <tt>desktop/control-center</tt>?</h3>
	
	<p>If you are trying to compile GARNOME on an Linux or BSD system, and get an error similar to the following:</p>
	
	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  "/home/ubuntu/garnome/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so: undefined reference to `g_key_file_get_integer'
	  /home/ubuntu/garnome/lib/libgnomevfs-2.so: undefined reference to `g_key_file_load_from_file'
	  /home/ubuntu/garnome/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.so: undefined reference to `g_file_set_contents'"
	</blockquote>
      </p>

	<p>You are trying to compile on a system that includes pesky .la files.</p>

	<p>
	  Some distributions install helper files with their development packages (Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, earlier Slackware's) that have hardcoded references to libraries in system directories.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Libtool then may choose to use the information from these files instead of probing your system for the correct location of your files, which can cause some parts of the GNOME build to link against libraries that have been supplied with your system, rather than those that work with GARNOME.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A workaround for this issue has been included with 2.12.0, however -- if you find that the problem still comes up, please report it as a bug to the maintainers of your distribution.
	</p>

	<h3>3.8 GARNOME fails with an error in <tt>desktop/gnome-games</tt>?</h3>

	<p>If you are trying to compile GARNOME on an Linux or BSD system, and get an error similar to the following:</p>

	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lguile-ltdl
	  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status"
	</blockquote>
      </p>

	<p>or:</p>

	<p>
	<blockquote>
	  "cscmi.o(.text+0x2b8): In function `add_slot':
	  : undefined reference to `SCM_CHARS'
	  cscmi.o(.text+0x2de): In function `add_slot':
	  : undefined reference to `SCM_CHARS'
	  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status"
	</blockquote>
      </p>

	<p>You are probably trying to compile gnome-games with either a 1.7.x 'preview release' version of guile, or a version of 1.6.x that has been compiled with the '--disable-depreciated' flag.</p>
	
	<p>As stated by the upstream <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=164522">bug</a>, to fix this, you will either need to obtain a fixed version of guile from your upstream vendor, or download and compile guile from SVN yourself.</p>

	<h3>3.9 Scrollkeeper seems to hang when running scrollkeeper-update?</h3>

	<p>Scrollkeeper takes a while to re-index everything in your local directory, it
	  hasn't hung -- it just takes a long time.</p>

	<h3>3.10 GARNOME installs a package I don't want, can I get rid of it?</h3>

	<p>Occasionally, a package is released that will not build on some systems, 
	  this can be due to a number of factors -- including:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Your system may lack the tools to compile a package</li>
	  <li>Your system may be too old to compile a package</li>
	  <li>The package conflicts with a library already on your system</li>
	  <li>There is a maintainer bug in the package</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The easiest solution to this problem is to remove the package directory
	  from it's meta-repository, eg:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		rm -rf fifth-toe/rhythmbox
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>Would remove the <tt>Rhythmbox</tt> package from the optional <em>fifth-toe</em> repository</p>

	<p><strong>caution:</strong> If a package located in the platform/ or desktop/ directory 
	  will not compile, please consult the mailing list archives for a possible solution BEFORE 
	  removing it -- as this action will probably damage the dependency checking that GARNOME 
	  uses to build a working installation.</p>

	<a name="4"></a>

	<h2>4. Post-Installation</h2>

	<h3>4.1 How do I start GARNOME after i've built it?</h3>

	<p>The <strong>first</strong> thing you should do, is to kill a redundant <em>gconfd</em>
	  process -- which probably exists if your machine runs an earlier release of GNOME -- so
	  that system-dependant processes, like ORBit, gconf and the GNOME Panel itself can work
	  correctly. To do this, you should find and kill gconf by typing:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		gconftool-2 --shutdown
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>The <strong>second</strong> thing you should do, depends on how you would usually start the GUI on your system:</p>

	<p>If you start X using the <abbr title="command line interface / prompt">CLI</abbr> and 
	  have used the <em>.xinitrc</em> session script as documented in the
	  README file, you should be able to type <tt>startx</tt> from the prompt to begin
	  using your new GARNOME desktop.</p>

	<p>If X starts when your machine starts, you should see the threads 
	  <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/garnome-list/2003-February/thread.html#00350">here</a>
	  or
	  <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/garnome-list/2004-May/thread.html#00111">here</a>
	  for some well written documentation on the subject from the GARNOME mailing lists.</p>

	<h3>4.2 I can see <em>icons</em> on my desktop, but no <em>fonts</em>?</h3>

	<p>You will need to build <em>freetype</em>, <em>xrender</em> and <em>xft</em> from the 
	  <tt>bootstrap/</tt> directory. Enter each directory and type <tt>make install</tt>, after
	  these have built successfully, restart your GARNOME session to have fonts displayed 
	  correctly.</p>

	<h3>4.3 I can see <em>fonts</em> on my desktop, but no <em>icons</em>?</h3>

	<p>You need to build <em>hicolor-icon-theme</em> and <em>shared-mime-info</em> from the
	  <tt>bootstrap/</tt> directory and add (if it doesn't exist) the <tt>XDG_DATA_DIRS</tt>
	  line to your GARNOME startup script.</p>

	<p><strong>Note:</strong> as of GARNOME 2.10, you need to run some additional 
	  commands to get this to work as expected -- after adding the required lines,
	  run (from the prompt):</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		$GARNOME/bin/update-desktop-database
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>and then:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		$GARNOME/bin/update-mime-database $GARNOME/share/mime
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>Then restart your GARNOME session to get your icons and associations back on track.</p>

	<h3>4.4 How do I use anti-aliased fonts?</h3>

	<p>Set the <strong>GDK_USE_XFT</strong> environment variable by typing:</p>

	<table id="t1">
	    <tr><td>
		export GDK_USE_XFT=1
	      </td></tr>
	</table>

	<h3>4.5 How do I see the hardware on my desktop? (iPod's / Cameras)</h3>

	<p>To use the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) on your desktop to detect things like an iPod, a Laptop Battery or a Camera, you will need to make sure that <tt>freedesktop/hal</tt> and <tt>freedesktop/dbus</tt> have been installed on your system, then make a script that correctly kills your system HAL daemon (if applicable) and starts the GARNOME version.</p>

	<p>An example script is on the <a href="docs.html">documentation</a> page.</p>

	<p>You would then run the script from within your GARNOME startup script, preferably before the <tt>gnome-session</tt> binary starts, to make sure everything starts in the correct order.</p>

	<a name="5"></a>

	<h2>5. Configuration</h2>

	<h3>5.1 I can't browse with Epiphany, my proxy settings are wrong?</h3>

	<p>Epiphany uses the GNOME default proxies. They can be modified (session wide) by using <tt>gnome-network-preferences</tt>. The corresponding gconf keys are <tt>/system/http_proxy/host</tt>, <tt>/system/http_proxy/port</tt> and <tt>/system/http_proxy/use_http_proxy</tt>.</p>

	<h3>5.2 Where did my evolution/ directory go?</h3>

	<p>As part of the upgrade to Evolution 2.0 or 2.2, the import wizard will copy
	  your Evolution directory to <tt>~/.evolution</tt>.</p>
	
	<p>The GARNOME maintainers recommend you keep a copy of your existing
	  <tt>~/evolution</tt> directory (if it exists), until you decide that you
	  no longer need it.</p>

	<a name="6"></a>

	<h2>6. Distribution Specific Issues</h2>

	<h3>6.1 Mandrake / Mandriva and the GNU iconv libraries</h3>
	
	<p>You may find that the <tt>platform/glib</tt> package will not build.</p>
	
	<p>This package is affected because the distributions listed above use the GNU iconv
	  libraries, which need to be manually enabled to be used under GARNOME</p>
	
	<p>Building the <tt>libiconv</tt> package from the bootstrap directory, then
	  removing the comment in the <strong>CONFIGURE_ARGS</strong> line in <tt>platform/glib</tt>
	  is the easiest fix for this issue.</p>

	<h3>6.2 Fedora Core 4 / Rawhide and the pilot-link libraries</h3>
	
	<p>You may find that the <tt>desktop/evolution</tt> package will not build.</p>
	
	<p>This package is affected because the distributions listed above use the pilot-link
	  0.12 libraries, while Evolution only supports the 0.11.x versions by default.</p>
	
	<p>GARNOME now includes a patch to update the pilot code in desktop/evolution and related 
	  packages. To use these patches, you must manually enable them by opening the Makefile
	  uncommenting the <strong>PATCHFILES</strong>
	  lines in the <tt>desktop/evolution</tt>, <tt>office/gnome-pilot</tt> and <tt>office/gnome-pilot-conduits</tt> packages
	  <strong>before</strong> beginning your GARNOME installation.</p>
	
	<p>If you have already started your GARNOME install, you must clean the packages first
	  by using the <em>make clean</em> command in the relevant directories, then you may resume
	  your build by running <em>make install</em> again.</p>

	<h3>6.3 <em>All</em> pre-2004 distributions and wireless-tools</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>geektoys/netapplet</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the gnome-system-tools package thought
	  your <em>wireless-tools</em> package was too old.</p>

	<p>Because the netapplet package is really experimental, it requires a version
	  of <em>wireless-tools</em> greater than <strong>0.27</strong> to work correctly.</p>

	<p>Finding and installing a package specifically built for your distribution is the
	  only supported fix for this issue.</p> 

	<a name="7"></a>

	<h2>7. Previous Release Distribution Specific Issues</h2>

	<h3>7.1 Debian Testing and esound</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>desktop/gnome-games</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the esound libraries in your distribution
	  are broken. This is a known bug and has been fixed in the unstable branch.</p>

	<p>Simply compiling <tt>platform/esound</tt> is the easiest fix for this issue.</p>

	<h3>7.2 Red Hat Linux 7.3/8/9 and OpenSSL / Kerberos</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>fifth-toe/gaim</tt>, <tt>desktop/evolution</tt> or
	  <tt>desktop/ximian-connector</tt> packages will not build.</p>

	<p>These packages are both affected by Red Hat's packaging of OpenSSL and the
	  Kerberos 5 libraries. According to <a href="http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82369">this post</a>
	  -- Red Hat's opinion seems to be a need to have these packages require pkg-config. 
	  Unfortunately, some earlier OpenSSL installations don't have the .pc support for
	  pkg-config niceness, so hacking the GARNOME makefiles to support .pc files
	  _might_ work, but you may need to do post-OpenSSL-buggery if your
	  distribution is RH7.3, 8 or an unpatched version of 9.</p>

	<p>The easiest <em>workaround</em> for problems with OpenSSL or Kerberos is edit to
	  edit the affected makefiles and add:</p>

	<p><tt>--with-krb5=/usr/kerberos</tt></p>

	<p>to the <strong>CONFIGURE_ARGS</strong> line, then re-run <tt>make clean</tt> and
	  <tt>make install</tt> from the prompt.</p>

	<h3>7.3 Slackware 9.x and XFree86 4.x</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>desktop/libxklavier</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because Slackware places their xkb libraries in a
	  non-standard directory.</p>

	<p>The easiest <em>workaround</em> for this issue is to edit the Makefile in
	  the <tt>desktop/libxlavier</tt> directory and add:</p>

	<p><tt>--with-xkb-base=/usr/X11/lib/X11/xkb</tt></p>

	<p>to the <strong>CONFIGURE_ARGS</strong> line, then re-run <tt>make clean</tt> and
	  <tt>make install</tt> from the prompt.</p>

	<h3>7.4 SuSE 9.x or Novell Linux Desktop and heimdal</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>bootstrap/mozilla</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the SuSE packaging of the heimdal 
	  libraries is rather broken. These distributions use an unsupported directory
	  prefix that the Mozilla makefiles do not understand.</p>

	<p>There is an unsupported patch for this problem <a href="ftp://cipherfunk.org/pub/patches/garnome/unsupported_patches/2.8.x/mozilla-suse9x-heimdal.patch">here</a>. 
	  Download the patch to your GARNOME directory and type <tt>patch -p1 < mozilla-suse9x-heimdal.patch</tt>, then re-run
	  <tt>make clean</tt> and <tt>make install</tt> from the prompt to restart the build.</p>

	<h3>7.5 Debian Unstable, Fedora Core 2 or 3, Mandrake Cooker and libexif</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>desktop/nautilus</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the distributions above ship <em>libexif</em> 0.6
	  while everyone else, including several third-party repositories ship 0.5.x</p>

	<p>There is already a patch included in GARNOME to resolve this issue, but it
	  is not built by default. To use the patch, you should edit the Makefile in the
	  <tt>desktop/nautilus</tt> directory and uncomment the <strong>PATCHFILES</strong>
	  line, then re-run <tt>make clean</tt> and <tt>make install</tt> from the prompt.</p>

	<h3>7.6 Debian Potato/Woody and pkgconfig</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>platform/pango</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the distributions listed above seem not to
	  have a <em>pkgconfig</em> that GARNOME can grok correctly.</p>

	<p>Building the <tt>pkgconfig</tt> and associated packages from the bootstrap/ 
	  directory is the easiest fix for this issue.</p>

	<h3>7.7 Debian Potato/Woody, Mandrake 8/9, Red Hat 7.3/8/9, SuSE 9.x and fontconfig</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>platform/vte</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the distributions listed above lack
	  a <em>fontconfig</em> package with support for recent versions of Pango</p>

	<p>Building the <tt>fontconfig</tt> and associated packages from the bootstrap/ 
	  directory is the easiest fix for this issue.</p>

	<h3>7.8 SuSE 9.x or Novell Linux Desktop and heimdal</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>bootstrap/firefox</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the SuSE packaging of the heimdal 
	  libraries is rather broken. These distributions use an unsupported directory
	  prefix that the Mozilla makefiles do not understand.</p>

	<p>There is an unsupported patch for this problem <a href="ftp://cipherfunk.org/pub/patches/garnome/unsupported_patches/2.10.x/firefox-suse9x-heimdal.patch">here</a>. 
	  Download the patch to your GARNOME directory and type <tt>patch -p1 < firefox-suse9x-heimdal.patch</tt>, then re-run
	  <tt>make clean</tt> and <tt>make install</tt> from the prompt to restart the build.</p>

	<h3>7.9 Slackware and rotten kernel include files</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>bootstrap/hal</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the location of the standard kernel include files
	  on your distribution is not in the standard path for the HAL configure test.</p>

	<p>There is an unsupported patch for this problem <a href="ftp://cipherfunk.org/pub/patches/garnome/unsupported_patches/2.10.x/hal-slackware-kernel-includes.patch">here</a>. 
	  Download the patch to your GARNOME directory and type <tt>patch -p1 < hal-slackware-kernel-includes.patch</tt>, then re-run
	  <tt>make clean</tt> and <tt>make install</tt> from the prompt to restart the build.</p>

	<h3>7.10 Red Hat 9 and binutils</h3>

	<p>You may find that the <tt>hacker-tools/ghex</tt> package will not build.</p>

	<p>This package is affected because the ghex makefiles don't recognize
	  <tt>libbfd-2.13.90.0.18.so</tt> as a valid linkable library.</p>

	<p>Adding a symlink from <tt>/usr/lib/libbfd-2.13.90.0.18.so</tt> to 
	  <tt>/usr/lib/libbfd.so</tt> is the easiest fix for this issue.</p>

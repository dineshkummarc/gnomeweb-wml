	  <p>Because accessibility is a core value the GNOME project,
	    GNOME has accessibility "built in" from the very early
	    days versus being "bolted on" as is done on other
	    graphical desktops.  On this page is a description of the
	    free open source solutions people with disabilities can
	    use to be successful with using GNOME to accomplish their
	    tasks, from e-mail to surfing the web to chatting with
	    friends, to editing documents, etc.</p>

	  <p>Please also visit the <a href="screencasts.html">screencasts</a>
	    page for examples of some of the GNOME accessibility
	    features in action.  The
            <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/nightly/gad.html">GNOME
          Accessibility Developer's Guide</a> also contains informative
          sections on "What is Accessibility?" and "Types of
          Disability."</p>

	  <h2>Keyboard Users</h2>
	  <p>GNOME
	  provides <a href="http://library.gnome.org/users/gnome-access-guide/nightly/keynav-0.html.en">full
	  keyboard access</a> to the desktop -- you can throw your
	  mouse away and accomplish everything from the keyboard
	  alone.  For users who need additional assistance using the
	  keyboard, GNOME
	  has <a href="http://library.gnome.org/users/gnome-access-guide/nightly/dtconfig-14.html.en">preferences
	  that allow you to make your keyboard more accessible</a>.
	  These include the following:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Simulate simultaneous keypresses - with StickyKeys,
	      users can enter multiple shift (or other) keys
	      individually but have the system process them as a
	      single combination keystroke.</li>
	    <li>Only accept long keypresses - with SlowKeys, keys must
	      be pressed for a given length of time before they are
	      accepted as input.</li>
	    <li>Ignore fast duplicate keypresses - with BounceKeys,
	      successive entry of the same key will only have a single
	      instance of that key accepted as input.</li>
	    <li>Adjust keyboard autorepeat feature - with RepeatKeys,
	      users can turn keyboard repeat on and off as well as
	      adjust the time before which a key starts repeating and
	      how fast a key repeats.</li>
	    <li>Control the mouse from the keyboard - with MouseKeys,
	      users can use the keypad to move the mouse as well as
	      perform click, double click, and drag operations.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Mouse Users</h2>
	  <p>Some users cannot use the keyboard at all, but can move
	    (and possibly click) the mouse. GNOME provides several
	    solutions that allow users to have complete access to the
	    desktop via the mouse alone:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Provide software clicking of the mouse when you hover
	      the mouse - with MouseTweaks, users can position the mouse
	      pointer over something and let it rest there. After a
	      configurable period of time, the system will perform a
	      click, double click, drag, or right click operation
	      wherever the mouse pointer is.</li>
	    <li>Enter text quickly - with
	      <a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/Demonstrations.html">Dasher</a>,
	      an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by
	      natural continuous pointing gestures, users have
	      achieved typing speeds of up to 35 words per minute and
	      more.</li>
	    <li>Type text using an onscreen keyboard - GNOME's
	      onscreen keyboard (GOK) provides a graphical
	      representation of the keyboard that you can click on to
	      type as well as select from a list of words that GOK
	      predicts you might be typing.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Switch Users</h2>
	  <p>Some users cannot use the keyboard or mouse, but can
	  interact with one or more switches connected to the
	  system.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Drive GNOME's onscreen keyboard (GOK) using one or
	      more switches - GOK provides a "scanning" mode that
	      allows the user to select items on the keyboard using a
	      switch.  It should be noted that GOK also has a "user
	      interface grab" feature that allows GOK to display user
	      elements, such as menu items, push buttons, etc., in its
	      display so that the user can more efficiently interact
	      with these items.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Low Vision Users</h2>
	  <p>Some users can see the screen, but just need to be able
	  to change the fonts, colors, and icons.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Adjust the fonts, colors and icons - with GNOME's
	      built-in theming mechanism, users can customize the font
	      sizes, colors, and icons used by the desktop and its
	      applications. GNOME also provides pre-defined themes for
	      high contrast, large print, and inverse colors.</li>
	    <li>Locate the mouse - users can configure the system to
	      highlight the mouse pointer when the right control key
	      is pressed.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>For other users, increasing the font size is not enough and
	    the user might need magnification instead.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Magnify the display - GNOME provides a trivial
	      magnifier that follows mouse position as well as a more
	      sophisticated magnifier that follows mouse position and
	      keyboard focus as well as use speech synthesis to
	      reenforce what is on the display.  Both magnifiers can
	      operate smoothly and quickly full screen mode.</li>
	  </ul>
	 
	  <h2>Blind Users</h2>
	  <p>Some users have difficulty seeing the screen at all.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Use a screen reader - with
	      GNOME's <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca">Orca screen
	      reader</a>, users have access to speech synthesis,
	      magnification, and braille representations of the
	      graphical desktop.</li>
	    <li>Hear when locking keys (e.g., CapsLock and NumLock)
	      are locked and unlocked - the Orca screen reader speaks
	      and braille notifications when locking modifiers change.
	      In addition, the ToggleKeys functionality of GNOME emits
	      an audible beep when locking modifiers change.
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Accessibility Infrastructure</h2>
	  <p>While not a solution that users interact with directly, 
	    GNOME's accessibility infrastructure, the "Assistive Technology
	    Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI)", is a built-in
	    component of GNOME that provides rich information for
	    assistive technologies to use. With the AT-SPI, screen
	    readers such as Orca and on screen keyboards such as GOK
	    get direct access to the components that make up the
	    display of a graphical application.  This includes access
	    to the menus, buttons, text areas, etc.</p>

 UNIX Accessibility overview
 ---------------------------
 This session provides a high-level overview of the terrain and features
 of the UNIX Accessibility landscape.  We will introduce UNIX, Linux, 
 and the Solaris Operating Environment; the various UNIX graphical desktop
 options, and summarize the different efforts underway to make all of the
 flavors and variants of UNIX accessible, including command-line
 accessibility as well as graphical desktop accessibility.  This session
 also serves as an introduction to the five following sessions in this room,
 which will discuss the aspects of UNIX accessibility in detail.

 Speakers: 
     - Peter Korn, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - J.P. Schnapper-Casteras, Palo Alto, CA
     - Gregg Vanderheiden, TRACE, Madison, WI 
     - Rich Burridge, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA


 9:20-10:20
 The Accessible GNOME 2 desktop: An Introduction
 -----------------------------------------------
 GNOME 2 is a modern desktop environment for the Solaris Operating
 Environment, Linux, and other UNIX systems, and is open source and free
 software. In this session we will give a guided tour of GNOME and its
 integrated accessibility features. We will begin by demonstrating the
 general features and capabilities of this intuitive desktop, then focus
 on accessibility solutions such as AccessX, keyboard navigation, and 
 theming support.  We will also provide an overview of important new
 assistive technologies being developed for GNOME (two of which are
 discussed in more detail in the following two sessions).

 Speakers: 
     - Gary Little, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - Peter Korn, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA

 10:40-11:40
 Gnopernicus: Screen Reading &amp; Magnification for GNOME
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Gnopernicus is an open-source screen reader and screen magnifier for
 the GNOME desktop, with full Braille support.  In this session we will
 demonstrate the features and functionality of Gnopernicus, demonstrating
 how users who are blind, need Braille, or have low-vision, can use
 a UNIX workstation for common desktop tasks.  We will also discuss how
 to participate in the open-source Gnopernicus project.

 Speakers: 
     - Thomas Friehoff, BAUM Retec, AG, Heidelberg Germany


 12:00-1:00
 GOK: a full featured on-screen-keyboard for GNOME
 -------------------------------------------------
 -- text coming from Jutta -- 

 Speakers: 
     - Jutta Treviranus, ATRC, Toronto, Canada
         and perhaps also
     - David Bolter, ATRC, Toronto, Canada


 2:00-3:00
 The GNOME Accessibility architecture in detail
 ----------------------------------------------
 In this technical session, we will discuss the GNOME Accessibility
 architecture in detail.  Specifically, we will look at the the ways
 that GTK+ and Java applications expose accessibility information, and
 the way that assistive technologies retrieve and use that information
 in order to present alternative user-interfaces.  

 Speakers: 
     - Bill Haneman, Sun Microsystems, Dublin, Ireland
     - Marc Mulcahy, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA


 3:20-3:50
 Misc. topics in UNIX Accessibility: panel discussion
 ----------------------------------------------------
 Additional and late-breaking topics in UNIX Accessibility, as well as
 a round-table panel discussion with the architects of GNOME and UNIX
 Accessibility

 Speakers: 
     - Bill Haneman, Sun Microsystems, Dublin, Ireland
     - Marc Mulcahy, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - Peter Korn, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - Earl Johnson, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - J.P. Schnapper-Casteras, Palo Alto, CA
     - Jutta Treviranus, ATRC, Toronto, Canada
     - Thomas Friehoff, BAUM Retec, AG, Heidelberg Germany


 4:10-5:10
 Topics in Java Accessibility
 ----------------------------
 The latest accessibility news for the Java platform, including a
 demonstration of access to Java applications from ZoomText, and a
 presentation on FreeTTS, an open source text-to-speech engine now
 available for the Java platform.

 Speakers: 
     - Peter Korn, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - Lynn Monsanto, Sun Microsystems, Palo Alto, CA
     - Willie Walker, Sun Microsystems, Burlington, MA
     - Mark Nelson, Ai Squared, Manchenster Center, VT

	  <p>The GNOME Accessibility project has been functioning
	  since October 2000.  Since that time, the project has
	  created the industry leading AT-SPI (Assistive Technology
	  Service Provider Interface), won several important awards,
	  and (most importantly) created a free open source platform
	  that provides compelling accessibility for a wide range of
	  disabilities.</p>

          <p>To learn more about accessibility,
          the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/accessibility-devel-guide/stable/gad.html">GNOME
          Accessibility Developer's Guide</a> contains informative
          sections on "What is Accessibility?" and "Types of
          Disability."  The remainder of the content on this page
	  describes solutions for specific disabilities and relevant
	  accessibility laws from around the world.</p>

	  <h2>Assistive Technology for Computers</h2>
	  <p>Assistive technology, also called accessibility aids, are
	  added to computers by people who use them to make computers
	  more accessible. Some common aids include the following:</p>

          <p><strong>Screen magnifiers</strong> help people with low
          vision. These utilities are like a magnifying glass. People
          using them are able to control what area of the computer
          screen they want enlarged, and can move that focus to view
          different areas of the screen. They are also known as screen
          enlargers or large print programs.</p>

	  <p><strong>Screen readers</strong> are for people who are
	  blind. These aids make on-screen information available as
	  synthesized speech or a refreshable Braille display. They
	  can only translate text based information. Graphics can be
	  translated if there is alternative text describing the
	  visual images. They are also known as blind access utilities
	  or screen reviewers.</p>

	  <p><strong>On-screen keyboards</strong> are used by people
	  who are unable to use a standard keyboard. An on-screen
	  keyboard lets people select keys using a pointing method
	  such as pointing devices, switches, or Morse-code input
	  systems.</p>

          <p><strong>Keyboard enhancement utilities</strong> are used
          by people who have trouble typing and controlling a
          mouse. They allow the user to perform complicated key
          sequences serially (e.g. Control-C), control the mouse
          pointer and buttons from the keyboard, and set the key
          repeat and acceptance rates. These ehancements are built
          into the base platform and are known as AccessX on
          Solaris/Linux, <a href="/AccessPac">AccessPac</a> on Microsoft
          Windows, and <a href="/EasyAccess">EasyAccess</a> on the
          Mac.</p>

	  <p><strong>Speech recognition</strong> programs are
	  primarily used by people with mobility impairments. These
	  utilities enable people to control computers with their
	  voice instead of a mouse or keyboard. They are also known
	  speech recognition programs.</p>

	  <p><strong>Alternative input devices</strong> allow
	  individuals to control their computers through means other
	  than a standard keyboard or pointing device. Examples
	  include smaller or larger keyboards, eye-gaze pointing
	  devices, and sip-and-puff systems controlled by breathing.</p>

	  <p>The following is a larger list af assistive technologies
	  broken down by the disability type who benefits from
	  them.</p>

          <h1 class="headerTitle">Relevant Accessibility Laws</h1>
	  <p>In addition to being the right thing to do, accessibility
	  is supported by a number of laws around the world.</p>

	  <h2>Australia</h2>
	  <p>Australia passed the Disability Discrimination Act of
	  1992 with specific provisions to accomodate people with
	  disabilities. Under Web &amp; IT Accessibility, Austalia has
	  established policy initiatives for accessibility of
	  electronic commerce and new service and information
	  technologies for older Australians and people with a
	  disability. As a part of this, the Cabinet on 21 March 2000
	  adopted specific accessibility requirements for Commonwealth
	  sites as part of its policy for use of the internet,
	  including requirements for:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>All Commonwealth departments and agencies to evaluate
            their sites for compliance with the <abbr title="World
            Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> accessibility standards
            from1 June 2000</li>
	    <li>All new contracted site work to include accessibility
            benchmarks from 1 June 2000</li>
	    <li>All Commonwealth sites to pass accessibility testing
            by reference to <abbr title="World Wide Web
            Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards by 1 December 2000.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Canada</h2>
	  <p>Policy on the Provision of Accommodation for Employees
          with Disabilities.  This policy became effective July 1,
          1999 and outlines the responsibilities regarding the
          employment accommodation of employees with disabilities.  In
          discharging this policy, the Government of Canada recognizes
          that the work environment of employees with disabilities
          must be adapted to meet their employment-related needs of
          employees with disabilities in the federal Public Service
          are met within reason - IT accommodation is an important
          part of this.</p>

	  <h2>Denmark</h2>
	  <p>Freedom to Choose Action Plan for IT Use by People with
          Disabilities. It essentially says the Danish info-society
          must be open to everyone - including people with
          disabilities. "Freedom to Choose - Action Plan for IT use by
          People with Disabilities" follows up the Government's IT
          Policy Action Plan 1995. In particular it says: "States
          should ensure that new computerised information and service
          systems offered to the general public are either initially
          accessible or are adapted to be made accessible to persons
          with disabilities."</p>

	  <h2>European Union</h2>
	  <p>2003 has been declared
          the <a href="http://www.eypd2003.com/">European Year of
          People with Disabilities</a>.  The European Commission
          launched the eEurope initiative on 8th December 1999 with
          the adoption of the Communication eEurope - An Information
          Society for all. The eEurope Action Plan associated with
          this initiative has set the following goals.</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>By the end of 2000: Review Information Society
            legislation and standards on accessibility. Recommendation
            to take account of people with disabilities in the public
            procurement of information and communications products and
            services.</li>
	    <li>By the end of 2001: Commitment to make all public Web
            sites and their content accessible to people with
            disabilities.</li>
	    <li>By the end of 2002: Create centres of excellence in
            each Member State to develop an <abbr title="European
            Union">EU</abbr> curriculum in Design-for-All.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Germany</h2>
	  <p>The <q><a href="http://www.behindertenbeauftragter.de/gesetzgebung/behindertengleichstellungsgesetz/gesetzestext">Behindertengleichstellungsgesetz</a></q>
          - BGG (law for equal treatment of people with disabilities)
          became effective in 2002. §11 of this law says that the
          german government promotes accessible user interfaces and
          web-sites for commercial products.  An appendix to this law
          (<q><a href="http://www.behindertenbeauftragter.de/gesetzgebung/behindertengleichstellungsgesetz/rechtsverordnung/rvo11bgg">Barrierefreie
          Informationstechnik-Verordnung</a></q> - BITV, RVO §11 BGG)
          requires government agencies to provide accessible graphical
          user interfaces and websites for publically available IT
          services they offer. More information can be found on the
          <a href="http://www.behindertenbeauftragter.de">official
          web-page</a> of the responsible government agency (german only).</p>


	  <h2>Ireland</h2>
	  <p>The Irish government has The Employment Equality Act and
          the Equal Status Act, which are modern anti-discrimination
          measures, and the Equality Authority Act, which is chartered
          to address violations of the first two Acts. The law also
          created the National Disability Authority Act led to a group
          who is responsible for, among other things, advising the
          Government on the coordination and development of policy
          disability issues.</p>

	  <h2>Portugal</h3>
	  <p>The Portuguese Accessibility Special Interest Group
          successfully petitioned and obtained a commitment on web
          site accessibility from the government of
          Portugal. Accessibility is now mandatory in Portugal for
          public and Administrative web sites.</p>

	  <h2>Spain</h3>
	  <p>The Spanish <a href="http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2003/12/03/pdfs/A43187-43195.pdf">Law 51/2003 (LIONDAU)</a>
	  establishes the basic conditions of accessibility and 
          non-discrimination for access and use of technologies, products 
          and services related to the information society and social 
          communication media. It extends the reach of the 
          <a href="http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2002/07/12/pdfs/A25388-25403.pdf">Law 34/2002 (LSSICE)</a>, 
          and includes design for all as a consideration into all 
          technologies, products and services from their conception to roll 
          out on the market. However, it is the <a href="http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2007/11/21/pdfs/A47567-47572.pdf">Royal Decree 1494/2007</a> 
          that translates the principles from these laws into specific 
          regulations. In practical terms this means:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li>Computer equipment and computer programs used by the 
            public administration, whose intended purpose is use by 
            the public in general, must be accessible to the elderly and 
            disabled in accordance with the guiding principle of "Design 
            for all" and the specific accessibility requirements demanded, 
            with preference given to the national technical standards that 
            incorporate European standards, international standards, other 
            systems of technical references prepared by the European 
            standardisation bodies or, failing that, national standards 
            (Standards <a href="http://www.udc.es/fcs/es/web-to/terapia/asignaturas/toyafam/08tema/UNE139801-2003.pdf">UNE 139801:2003</a> 
            and <a href="http://www.udc.es/fcs/es/web-to/terapia/asignaturas/toyafam/08tema/UNE139802-2003.pdf">UNE 139802:2003</a>)</li>

	    <li>The information available on the public administration 
             websites shall be accessible to the elderly and disabled, 
	    with a minimum level of accessibility that shall meet 
	    priorities 1 and 2 of Standard <a href="http://www.inteco.es/file/rWv1Oqb051U">UNE 139803:2004</a>.</li>

	    <li>The public administration shall promote measures for 
	    raising awareness, informing, educating and, especially, 
	    training in the area of accessibility.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h2>Sweden</h2>
	  <p>In August 1996 the Government commissioned the Swedish
          Handicap Institute to develop a programme of IT-based
          measures aimed at disabled and elderly people. The aim of
          the program is to provide the basis for a more concerted
          effort within the area of IT for disabled and elderly
          people. The work has been carried out in close conjunction
          with the organisations and authorities concerned.</p>
	  
	  <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
	  <p>The <a href="
          http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1995/1995050.htm">Disability
          Discrimination Act 1995</a> originally primarily covered
          employment issues and the provision of goods, facilities and
          services.  Another act,
          the <a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010010.htm">
          Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001</a>,
          extends this act to require schools to put in place plans to
          provide equal access to educational materials and their
          delivery.</p>

	  <h2>United States</h2>

	  <p>There are three key pieces of legislation relating to
          accessibility in the United States:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.access-board.gov/508.htm">Section
            508 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act</a> requires that
            electronic and information technology developed, procured,
            maintained, or used by the Federal government be
            accessible to people with disabilities.  The onus is on
            the U.S. Federal agency to only purchase accessible
            information technology. Section 508 went into effect June
            21, 2001, and was 
	    <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/refresh/report/">refreshed</a>
            in April 2008.</li>

	    <li>The <a href="http://www.eeoc.gov/ada/adatext.html">Americans
            with Disabilities Act</a> (see
            <a href="http://www.adata.org/adaportal/General/ADA_Overview.html">
            overview</a>) recognizes and protects the civil rights of
            people with disabilities and is modeled after earlier
            landmark laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of
            race and gender. The ADA covers a wide range of
            disability, from physical conditions affecting mobility,
            stamina, sight, hearing, and speech to conditions such as
            emotional illness and learning disorders.</li>

	    <li><a href="http://www.access-board.gov/telecomm/">Section
	    255 of the Telecommunications Act</a> provides that a
	    manufacturer of telecommunications equipment or customer
	    premises equipment shall ensure that the equipment is
	    designed, developed, and fabricated to be accessible to
	    and usable by individuals with disabilities, if readily
	    achievable. Further, a provider of
	    telecommunications services shall ensure that the service
	    is accessible to and usable by individuals with
	    disabilities, if readily achievable.  Along with Section 508,
	    Section 255 was was 
	    <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/refresh/report/">refreshed</a>
            in April 2008.</li>

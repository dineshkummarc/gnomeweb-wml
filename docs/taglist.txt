<set-last-changed "$Date$">
	This tag sets the last-changed date for the document, so that
	the templates can present this to the user.

<document title="doctitle"></document>
	Encloses the whole document.

<content banner-img banner-alt></content>
	Encloses the body text of the document. Banner-img is the descriptive part
	of the banner image file name. For instance, putting "seegnome" here
	results in banner-seegnome.png (or gif in the future) being used as the
	title for the page. The banner-alt is the alt text for the image. Please
	enclose in qoutes.

<a countclicks=1></a>
	Works just like the normal <a></a>, but has a few more attributes
	to let the framework do fun things with the links.

<user-annotations>
	Indicates a place in the content where users are allowed to insert
	annotations.

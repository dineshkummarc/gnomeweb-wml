<p>Before you begin, visit the web pages of the modules you need to
modify and do your best to learn how they work on your own.  Good
hackers are good learners; if you're not familiar with the way the
code you're hacking works, read through any available documentation,
check out the mailing list archives, and browse the code.  Do this
<i>before</i> you start asking questions of the individual developers.
This contest is going to attract a lot of attention and we don't want
to overrun the hackers with newbie questions.</p>

<p>Once you've done this, go ahead and check with developers to learn
about their individual patch acceptance policies. In the case of
Evolution, that means reading the <a
href="http://developer.ximian.com/projects/evolution/contributing.html">developer
contributions page</a> and <a
href="http://developer.ximian.com/projects/evolution/patch_guidelines.html">patch
guidelines</a>.  </p> <p> To build / hack on OpenOffice.org, see <a
href="http://ooo.ximian.com/"> ooo.ximian.com</a> for instructions on
getting started, patch generation / submission and IRC in the
hackers-guide.  </p>

<p> Some of the projects in this contest require a lot of work in
multiple modules, and may be difficult for one person to complete.
You might want to hang out on the IRC channels for the various
affected projects and find other people to team up with for some of
the particularly arduous bounties.  Working as a team can offer you a
big advantage.  Then, appoint one person to apply for and collect the
bounty. It is important that it is only one person- we will not deal
with multiple people and the responsibility of dividing up a bounty.
That person can distribute the prize to everyone else on your team, as
you see fit.  </p>

<p>There will be an IRC channel on <b>irc.gimp.org</b> for the bounty
hunt; you can hang out with us there on <b>#bounties</b>.  This will
be a good place to ask questions about the contest and to find other
people to work with.  For specific technical questions about a given
module, you should use that module's mailing lists and IRC
channels.</p>

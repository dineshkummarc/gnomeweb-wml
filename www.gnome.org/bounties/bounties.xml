<bug>127532</bug> <solved>http://www.gnome.org/~markmc/clock-evo-integration.diff</solved>
<html><![CDATA[
<p>When you click on the clock on the GNOME panel, a little calendar
descends.  A proper integration patch for this calendar would do the
following:</p>
<img border=0 align=right src="panel-calendar.png" alt="">

<ul> 
<li>Highlight in bold the days which have appointments.</li><br>
<li>Below the calendar, show a small summary of the appointments on the selected day.</li><br>
<li>Double clicking on a day opens the Evolution calendar to that day.</li><br>
<li>Aggregate multiple calendars, with a configuration dialog to select which calendars to aggregate.</li><br>
<li>Redo the QuickAlarm frame <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="http://patches.ximian.com/download.cgi?object=gnome-panel-clock.patch-3">patch</a> to take up less space.</li>
</ul>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

There is code in gnome-cal.c and tag-calendar.c which is in <? bonsai
("evolution/calendar/gui/"); ?> to tag the mini calendar in Evolution,
which should serve as a useful starting point.  Essentially you will
need to create an ECalView (see <?php bonsai
("evolution-data-server/calendar/libecal"); ?>, and monitor it to
track the changes.  You can create a different ECalView for the
current day to get the list of events for the day and monitor them if
there are changes.

 <?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>
 
The clock applet is part of the <? bonsai ("gnome-panel"); ?> 
module. You will need to make use of the new calendar APIs in <?
bonsai ("evolution-data-server/calendar/libecal"); ?>.

<?php box_sec ("Pointers"); ?>

<p>Evolution's contact editor allows you to annotate a contact with
the dates of their birthday and anniversary.  However, these dates <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" 
href="contact-bday.png"><img border=0 align=right

into your calendar.  Unless you explicitly add the dates to your
calendar, you won't see them when you glance through your schedule,
and an alarm won't fire to warn you of a friend's upcoming
birthday.</p>

<p>Clearly, this is a travesty.</p>

<p>The right solution is to create a special calendar backend which
reads birthdays and anniversaries out of the user's addressbook.
Using Evolution 2.0's calendar aggregation feature, the user can then

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Gaim/addressbook identity integration]]></title>  <amount>2500</amount> <category>Addressbook</category>
<bug>127513</bug> <solved>http://www.chipx86.com/gevolution/</solved>
<html><![CDATA[


<p>Gaim should be able to synchronize its buddy lists with the
Evolution addressbook. You will need to decide the details of this
work and discuss them with the other Gaim and Evolution
developers. Some beginning features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Auto-add buddies to your buddy list if their IM fields exist in  Evolution.</li>
<li>Auto-add buddies to your addressbook when you add them to your buddy list in Gaim. 
<li>Allow a user to select an addressbook entry that corresponds to a
buddy, which will fill the IM field of that addressbook entry. This
might work better if you can use the minicard widget and display a
list of minicards.</li>
<li>For extra credit: Allow the user to drag and drop buddies and
contacts between Gaim and Evolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the user clicks on the "Add Buddy" button in Gaim, or selects
the "Add a buddy" menu item, a dialog should appear allowing him to
select someone from his addressbook:</p>

<center>
<img src="IM-addbuddy1.png"><br>
</center>

<p>A separate entry should appear for each IM account a contact has,
so that the user can choose to add someone's AIM account to the buddy
list, for example, but not his Yahoo account.</p>

<p>If the user clicks on the "New Person" button, he gets prompted to
add a new contact and buddy at the same time:</p>

<center>
<img src="IM-addbuddy2.png"><br>
</center>

<p>Entering the contact's IM account information is required.
Entering his contact information is optional.</p>

<p>This same dialog will pop up if the user hits "Select Buddy" for a
contact whose IM information is not available in the Evolution
addressbook.  The user will have the opportunity to fill in the IM
information for that person, which will then be added to the Evolution
addressbook and the buddy list at the same time.</p>

<center>
<img src="IM-addbuddy3.png"><br>
</center>

<p>When "Add Buddy" is clicked, the person's IM account name is added to
the buddy list, and a new contact is added to the Evolution
addressbook.</p>

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Gaim/Evolution presence integration]]></title>  <amount>2000</amount> <category>IM</category>
<bug>127546</bug>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>We want the notion of &quot;presence&quot; to be integrated into
the entire desktop, wherever the user encounters a person or a
reference to a person.</p>

<p>Providing a simple integrated presence concept in the mailer and
addressbook user interfaces is a step in this direction.</p>

<p>Post-2.0, Evolution will begin to integrate presence functionality
into the backend addressbook APIs.  That means that given a contact,
you'll be able to programmatically ask the addressbook questions like:
&quot;Is this user online?&quot; and &quot;How can I send him a
file?&quot;</p>

<p>That is our eventual goal.  This task is focused on more surface,
frontend integration.</p>

<p>This item has several subtasks, all of which involve displaying an
icon somewhere in Evolution to indicate whether a person is online or
not, and to allow the user to click on this icon to open an IM
conversation window with the person concerned.</p>

<p>And so, the first challenge is to have a simple, general mechanism
for displaying <b>presence icons</b>.</p>

<table border=1 align=right>
<tr>
<td width="33%"><center><img border=0 src="buddy-online.png" alt="Online icon"><br><tt>online</tt></center></td>
<td width="33%"><center><img border=0 src="buddy-offline.png" alt="Offline icon"><br><tt>offline</tt></center></td>
<td width="33%"><center><img border=0 src="buddy-away.png" alt="Away icon"><br><tt>away</tt></center></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=3><i><font size=-4>You don't have to use exactly these icons or exactly these meanings. This is just to give a general idea, and an example of what to use in case the user doesn't have a buddy icon set. We can design better suitable icons if needed.</font></i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The presence icon could be the "Buddy Icon" from Gaim. It
represents the other person well since everyone can control and update
their own buddy-icon.  We can show online/offline/away status with a
text label below the icon, plus for "away" we can desaturate the icon
and make it 50% transparent.  Examples are below.</p>

<p align=center><img src="online-offline-evo.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The Presence Icon can be used to invoke the appropriate gaim-remote
mechanisms to pop up an IM window with the user.</p>

<p>Evolution 2.0's addressbook allows the user to set a custom picture
for an addressbook entry.  This custom image should override the buddy
icon if it is set.</p>

Here are the places where a presence icon should be added to
Evolution:

<ol>

<li>In the message view (the window or pane displaying the contents of
a single mail message), display a full-size presence icon next to the
sender's name.<br>

<p align="center"><img src="imstatus-mailmessage.png" alt=""></p></li>

<li>Put a small presence icon next to names in the To:, Cc: and Bcc:
fields in the message composer window.  Buddy icons should also appear
for the relevant names in the recipient picker dialog, message
summaries, and preview panes.  Anywhere that currently displays "Foo
Bar &lt;foo@bar.com&gt;" could be extended to display "[ ] Foo Bar
&lt;foo@bar.com&gt;".  And again, clicking on these icons should pop
up a small floating dialog (like you get when right clicking an email
address in evolution) - and it lists you actions for sending IM messages
and such.<br>

<p align="center"><img src="imstatus-mailcomposer.gif" alt=""></p></li>

<li> Add a presence status field to the address book, so that the user
knows when a contact is online via IM, and can click to send an
instant message.  This field should be viewable in the minicard view
as the contact's buddy icon, in the list view as a separate column,
and in the contact editor dialog.</li>

</ol>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

Both <? bonsai ("evolution"); ?> and <? bonsai ("gaim"); ?> are affected.

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p> 

First you will need to allow Evolution to determine if someone is
online. You may wish to work with <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" 
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/gaim/gaim/src/gaim-remote.c?view=markup"><tt>gaim-remote</tt></a>,
a command-line tool which communicates with a running gaim process
over a local Unix domain socket.  </p>

<p>You will want to extend the <tt>gaim-remote</tt> protocol to
support the &quot;<tt>ison</tt>&quot; mechanism.  You may also want to
separate <tt>gaim-remote</tt> into a library, maybe called
<tt>libgaimremote</tt> and a front-end command line tool.  Evolution
and <tt>gaim-remote</tt> will both use <tt>libgaimremote</tt>, which
should expose a non-blocking API.</p>

<p>On top of this library, you will want to build a widget which
handles all the rendering and interaction associated with a presence
icon.  This widget could probably exist inside Evolution at first,
though eventually it would be ideal if it were available to the entire
desktop.</p>

<p>Then you need to use this API to add the icons to various places where
addresses are displayed and formatted, including:
<p>
<dl>

<dt><?php bonsai ("evolution/addressbook/gui/component/select-names"); ?></dt>

<dd>This is used by the mail composer for the to/cc/bcc entry
widgets.  This will need to be extended to include the presence widget
for each name entered.
</dd>

<dt><?php bonsai ("evolution/mail/e-format-html-display.c"); ?></dt>
<dd>This formats messages for display.  You will have to output a tag
for a custom object, and in the object return handler, setup the
presence widget.
<b>NOTE:</b> All formatting operations are
done from a separate thread so no non-formatting logic can be
performed there.
</dd>

<bug>127551</bug> <solved>www.es.gnome.org/~telemaco/nautilus-sendto-0.1-1.tar.gz</solved>
<html><![CDATA[

<p> The Nautilus file manager has a context menu item for "Send
to...", which opens the Evolution composer to mail a selected file to
someone.  This task involves implementing three major improvements to
this feature:

<ol>

<li>If you select multiple files, Nautilus should automatically prompt
you to create an archive (zip, tar, etc - user's choice) and mail that
instead.</li>

<li>Allow the user to send the files to another user over IM instead of
email. The user should be prompted to select an online buddy from the 
buddy list.  Be sure to only display the buddies can accept
file transfers.</li>

<li>Provide a recipient selection dialog that does name and address
completion.</li>

</ol>

Below is an animated mockup of a "Send to..." dialog that incorporates
all these improvements, and has a nice completion mechanism.

<p align=center><img border=0 src="send_file-anim-mockup.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If the user has selected only one file and it is not a directory,
then we can present him with a simpler dialog including only the
recipient and the medium:</p>

<p align=center><img border=0 src="send_file_single.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>After the user clicks "Send" he gets either a IM "send file" dialog
or a mail composer window with the file(s) attached.</p>

<p>To implement this feature nicely, you may want to integrate with
file roller for the archive creation.  And you should in some way
indicate the total size of the compressed archive or file being sent
to the user.</p>

<bug>127516</bug>
<solved>http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/evolution/plugins/new-mail-notify/</solved>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>
An often requested feature has been to have new mail notified via the panel.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
There are two parts to this task. The first is to write a panel applet
component for the user interface.  This should be incorporated into
the mail code (as em-panel-applet.c), and it should attempt to insert
itself into the panel notification area when the mailer starts up.
The applet should be started from mail-component-factory.c and be
configurable in the usual manner.
</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="" src="email-notification.gif" /></p>
<p>
The second part is to hook into new mail events.  Currently all new
mail events are routed (from multiple threads) through
mail-folder-cache.c, so it can trivially be hooked up into the appropriate
place in the real_flush_updates function in that file.
</p><p>
This code should also either merge with or replace the current new
mail notification code in mail-folder-cache.c and the preferences
pages.  The original functionality must work if there are no panels running
in the current session and the applet is not started.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

<? bonsai ("evolution/mail"); ?>

<?php box_sec ("Extended functionality"); ?>

<p>
It would be nice to only watch specific folders or stores rather than
all folders.  This could re-use the folder selector widget and
configuration mechanism as used for offline mode selection.  It would
probably be appropriate to support drag and drop of folders from the
folder list onto the applet to add/remove them from the list of
watched folders.
<p>
Another extension would be to use different
colors/methods/sounds to indicate the new mail depending on the
folder/store or priority of the folder.  This is all applet-specific code.

<html><![CDATA[

<p>Many mailing lists follow <?php rfc(2369); ?> and provide mailing list
information in their email headers.  This information can be used by
mail clients to present mailing list management functions to users.
For example, a mailing list can provide information on unsubscribing

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
The RFC gives these actions:
<ul>
<li>Unsubscribe - How to remove yourself from the list.
<li>Subscribe - How to subscribe to the list.  (Helpful for forwarded messages.)
<br><br>
<li>Help - How to get more information about the mailing list.
<li>Owner - The contact information for the list administrator.
<li>Archive - Access to the list archives.
<br><br>
<li>Post - How to post to the list.
</ul>
<p>

Note that the formats of these fields can vary widely and may contain multiple URLs or actions which provide the same result.  Also, there is no reason to expect that a mailing list which includes one or more mailing list headers will include all of them.
<p>
Evolution should provide an interface to these actions.  If any of these headers are present in a message, Evolution should present them in a "List" submenu off the "Actions" menu.  A successful patch to Evolution should follow the usability guidelines mentioned in the RFC.
<p>
The only special action is "Post."  If a mailing list has a "Post" header of "NO" then posting is not allowed on this list.  Replies to this message should only go to the message sender; the "Reply to List" menu item should be disabled.  The "Reply to List" menu item should always follow the "Post" header clue.  <tt>EMFolderView</tt> manages these menus.

<bug>127519</bug> <solved>http://home.wanadoo.nl/meilof/evolution-nntp-patch-17</solved>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>
Evolution has some initial NNTP (NEWS, or NNRP) support, but it is incomplete.
This task is to fill out the NNTP implementation and provide a
suitable user-interface for managing NNTP sessions.
<p>
This would help us get more adoption of Evolution inside the
OpenOffice team, since they use news for all their internal
discussions.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

<ul>
<li><? bonsai ("evolution/camel/providers/nntp"); ?>, is the existing
NNTP implementation, which should be extended/completed, rather than
being rewritten.
<li><? bonsai ("evolution/mail"); ?>, may need work for handling NNTP addressing.
<li><? bonsai ("evolution/composer"); ?>, similarly.
</ul>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
The first aim should be to complete the CamelStore and CamelFolder
implementation of the NNTP provider.
<p>
For CamelNNTPStore, the folder list should be stored in a
CamelStoreSummary, which will require writing a CamelNNTPStoreSummary in
the same vein as CamelImapStoresummary.  It should support two modes,
one for a flat '.' separated list of folders, and another implementing
a hierarchy of folders canonicalized into '/' separated paths.
Once complete, offline operation, and the subscription interface can be implemented.
<tt>get_folder_info</tt> must also be finished, currently it doesn't
honor the path or mode arguments.
<p>
CamelNNTPFolder needs to have the append() method
implemented, which will be used to POST messages to the NNTP store.
<p>
The composer already has support for posting to folders, but it may
need additional support for NNTP addressing and cross-posting to NNTP
folders and email addresses.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Extended functionality"); ?>

<p>CamelNNTPStoreSummary could also interact and cache standard NNTP
folder information into ~/.newsrc, to work with legacy news readers.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Pointers"); ?>

<p>
The NNTP protocol is described in <?php rfc(977); ?>.  An
additional information RFC, <?php rfc(2980); ?> provides an

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Inline PGP support for evolution]]></title>  <amount>250</amount> <category>Mailer</category>
<bug>127521</bug>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>
An often requested feature for Evolution is to support inline-pgp
('clearsigned') secure emails, in addition to the PGP-MIME format we
already support.  This will aid interoperability with legacy
secure-mail implementations.
<p>
See bugs <?php bug(17540); ?>, and <?php bug(17541); ?>.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

<ul>
<li><? bonsai ("evolution/mail") ?> will require changes to recognize
inline pgp armoring and for formatting signature info.
<li><? bonsai ("evolution/camel") ?> contains pgp verification code.
</ul>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
<tt>mail/em-inline-filter.c</tt> already has code (some commented out)
to identify and separate inline pgp messages into separate
CamelMimePart objects.  This needs to be activated, and the content type (in
<tt>emif_types[]</tt> needs to be changed to something unique
(&quot;application/x-inline-pgp&quot; perhaps?).
<p>
<tt>mail/em-format-html-display.c</tt> then needs to be modified to
handle that mime-type (see <tt>type_builtin_table</tt>).  It should use
similar code to <tt>efhd_application_xpkcs7mime</tt> or
<tt>efhd_multipart_signed</tt>, and should share common code where
appropriate.  Some of this code is currently undergoing changes, so
discuss this on the lists first.
<p>
Finally, you need to support this (pseudo) mime-type in
<tt>camel/camel-gpg-context.c:gpg_verify</tt>.  It already has code to
test the mime type of the incoming part, this just needs to be
extended to execute a different code path for the inline-pgp type.  It
may also need additional support in the <tt>gpg_ctx</tt> engine (in
the same file).
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Extended functionality"); ?>

<p>
Allow the sending of ASCII armored PGP (aka inline pgp) messages too.
This requires adding the support for inline signing to
<tt>camel-gpg-context.c</tt>, and passing the option to it from the
security configuration page via the composer signing code in
<tt>composer/e-msg-composer.c:build_message</tt>.  See the way
<tt>camel-smime-context.c</tt> implements it's <tt>sign_mode</tt>
option for how this should be done.

<p>As in <?php bug(1186); ?>, it would be nice to configure the header

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
EMFormat already has api for setting which headers are displayed
by default, so most of the backend work is already done.  What is
required is a GUI for configuring the options, and glue to store the
options.
<p>
The configuration GUI should be a new tab on the Mailer Settings page.
A new tab should be created in the glade file
<? bonsai ("evolution/mail/mail-config.glade"); ?>, and hooked into
<? bonsai ("evolution/mail/em-mailer-prefs.c"); ?>, and it should store
the options in a gconf key under &quot;/apps/evolution/mail/display&quot;, for
example <b>&quot;headers&quot;</b>.  The key should be a simple string
array.
<p>
<? bonsai ("evolution/mail/em-folder-view.c"); ?> is used to listen to
configuration changes used by EMFormat, <tt>emfv_setting_notify</tt> needs to
be extended to include the new gconf key to manage the header list.
<p>
A FIXME in
<? bonsai ("evolution/mail/em-format.c"); ?><tt>:emf_format_clone</tt>
needs to be finished to complete the task so the headers displayed are
properly honored for printing and redisplays.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Extended functionality"); ?>

<p>EMFormat (and EMFormatHTML) also defines properties for each
header (e.g. <b>BOLD LABEL</b>).  These could be added to the
configuration page and configuration key, and even extended.

<p>
Since the iPod supports calendars and addressbooks, it would be handy for
<img border=0 src="ipod.png" align=right alt="">

Evolution users to be able to automatically and easily synchronize

their personal data to their iPods.  Because the iPod is a read-only
device &mdash; the iPod cannot modify the data &mdash; the
&quot;synchronization&quot; is really just a one-way copy from
Evolution to the iPod.
</p>
<p>
Your solution must synchronize three kinds of data:

<li>Contacts in the addressbook</li>
<li>Events in the calendar</li>
<li>Task list ("To Do" in the iPod)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The difficult part of this work will be to create a simple and

<p>Evolution and the GNOME project as a whole both use Bugzilla to
track bugs. Since Evolution is used by many GNOME developers, it would
be useful to have some degree of integration with Bugzilla.

</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

<p>You will need to add a way to add a bugzilla server to your list of

and optionally have it remember his password.)</p>

<p>Evolution will have to parse the output of Bugzilla's "query.cgi"
page, and extract the list of saved queries from the pop-up at the
bottom. Each saved query should show up as a folder on that server in
Evolution.</p>

<p>When the user opens the folder, Evolution will fetch the results of
that query and show a task item for each bug. The summary of the task
should be the summary of the bug, and the URL field of the task should
be a link to the relevant bugzilla entry. If the user opens the bug,
the "Description" field should show the rest of the information. The
backend will probably need to be read-only.</p>

<bug>127537</bug> <solved>http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/evolution-data-server/calendar/backends/weather/</solved> 
<html><![CDATA[

<img border=0 src="suncloud.png" align=right alt="">
Write a calendar backend that contacts some weather source and provides
weather forecast data for the upcoming week or so as all-day events, so
it shows up in your calendar. This information should be cached locally,
so you can view it when offline.

<p>A mockup on how it should be integrated on the calendar view is below.</p>
<img src="cal-weather.png" align="center">

<? box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>The backend just has to get the weather forecast information from
some place (determining that place is part of the job for this bounty,
you might start by looking at where the weather applet gets its
information) and, using ECalBackendFile, create a local copy of that
information (an all day event for each day) in the local file managed
by ECalBackendFile. The backend should probably remove old weather
forecasts, and just keep the ones for the current day and future
days.</p>

<p>The only question remaining is how to allow users to add that backend
to the list of calendars configured. An option could be to create the 'Weather'
calendar on startup, so that it's always available to users. Although there
probably should be a way to add it back if a user ever removes it. In that
case, the 'New Calendar' dialog, new-calendar.c in (<? bonsai ("evolution/calendar/gui/dialogs"); ?>)
could be extended to support the addition of local, remote and any special
kind of calendar backends (weather, birthdays, etc).</p>

<p>Another solution could be to have a config control page for the weather backend,
so that it can ask users all the required information.</p>

<p>Also, a way to use the different weather icons is needed. The best way could be
to use the categories stuff, which unfortunately is hard coded (a fixed set of categories
and icons for those categories is available), so there is the need to have a way for the
backend to register those new categories (Sunny, Rainy, etc) and the icons
associated with it.</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

<ul>
<li><? bonsai ("evolution-data-server/calendar/backends"); ?> is where
your new backend should reside.
<li><? bonsai ("evolution-data-server/src"); ?> server needs to register
the method (e.g. weather://) that maps to the backend.
</ul>

<?php box_sec ("Tips"); ?>

Use one of the existing backends, probably the http backend, as a
starting point. Grep sources for &quot;webcal&quot; and see how
it's hooked in. The old summary code used to pull weather data,
so that should provide some clues too.

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Advanced LDAP Configuration]]></title>  <amount>250</amount> <category>Addressbook</category>
<bug>127525</bug>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>Evolution can store contacts in an LDAP directory, but there is no way
to tell Evolution exactly where in the directory contact data should
be stored. </p>

<p>For example, user accounts are stored in
<tt>ou=Accounts,dc=gnome,dc=org</tt> but you may want to store the
addressbook in <tt>ou=miguel,ou=AddressBooks,dc=gnome,dc=org</tt>,
another user may want his addressbook in
<tt>ou=nat,ou=AddressBooks,dc=gnome,dc=org</tt>, etc.  Currently,
Evolution just puts things in the root <tt>dn</tt>
(<tt>dc=gnome,dc=org</tt>) which isn't very convenient.</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

<ul>
<li><? bonsai ("evolution-data-server/addressbook/backends/ldap"); ?><li> and <? bonsai ("evolution/addressbook/gui/component"); ?></ul>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
There are a few places that need changing for this to work.  An extra
field needs to be added to the LDAP config UI.  It should probably
default to whatever the user typed in for the search base (since
many/most times they will be the same.)
</p>

<p>
The ldap:// URLs we generate will also need to have the additional
argument added to them.  There is no place in the RFC-specified URL
for the value, so they should be added like we already do with
limit/ssl/timeout arguments.  This will require changing code in both
<tt>addressbook-storage.c</tt> and in the <tt>_load_uri method</tt> of
the LDAP backend.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the <tt>_create_contact</tt> method in the LDAP backend will
need to call <tt>create_dn_from_contact</tt> using the proper creation
root, instead of the rootdn as it does now.

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Publish your calendar]]></title>  <amount>2000</amount> <category>Calendar</category>
<bug>127538</bug>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>
   Apple's iCal has made "calendar sharing" popular. It's a nice feature where any user can create a calendar
   of events and then publish it on a website, to share it with other users. Others can then "subscribe" their
   calendar application to that calendar file, and updates are automatically synced to their imported calendar
   whenever the master file changes. This makes it easy and convenient to share conference schedules, meeting
   times, club events, moving dates and times and so on.
</p>

<p>
   Implement this calendar publishing feature in Evolution. There are two things: first, it needs to just upload
   the .ics file to a remote location, using gnome-vfs facilities (give the user a few common choices like
   ssh://, FTP, WebDav and saving to a file. Then automatically push updates to the exported file whenever new
   events are added or things are being changed. A GUI mockup for exporting is provided below:
</p>

<center>
<img src="publish_calendar.png" border=0>
</center>

<p>
   We should give a possibility to export to a simple HTML page as well for those visitors who don't use a
   calendar program that supports webcal:// (webcal is just a URI scheme that should invoke Evolution's
   "Calendar Import" dialog that does the same as this one but reverse).
</p>

<!--
<p>
   Also, you can use <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="http://phpicalendar.sf.net">PhpICalendar</a> to make a dynamic web page for users
   that have PHP support on their server. Evolution could contain a working, stable snapshot of phpical in the
   distribution and you could upload it and set it up for the user's website (proper error checking should
   naturally be carried out, including checking for an existing installation of phpical).
</p>
-->

<?php box_sec("Affected Modules"); ?>

<p>
   Both <? bonsai("evolution"); ?> and <? bonsai("evolution-data-server"); ?> will be affected.
</p>

<?php box_sec("How"); ?>

<p>
   Augment the calendar's http backend with the necessary export capabilities. The backend resides in
   <? bonsai ("evolution-data-server/calendar/backends/http"); ?>, and uses the file backend to operate on
   locally cached calendars. The backend could also handle the HTML generation, exporting it to one or more
   files alongside the ICS file. New named options need to be added to the backend's ESource - e.g.
   user, password, and a flag indicating whether to generate HTML. Additional GUI elements need to be
   added to <? bonsai ("evolution/calendar/gui"); ?> and <? bonsai ("evolution/calendar/gui/dialogs"); ?>.
</p>

<p>
   When implementing the HTML generator, you may want to look at HTML
  output from existing web calendars such as <a STYLE="text-decoration:none"

  Evolution has a quick reference section in the manual, but it's not

  the wall.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
<p>
  The simplest approach to this will be to take the
  content from the "menuref.xml" help file in Evolution, and format it
  nicely as a card using any open-format desktop publishing tool (TeX,
  OpenOffice.org, etc.)  Convert the output to
  Postscript or PDF format, and create a link to it from the Help menu
  in Evolution.  Be sure to check that the content is up to date, and
  matches the Evolution development branch. Provide both the original
  and the PDF formatted version of your file.
 </p>

<p>
  Then, add a menu item in the Help menu. Make sure when you do so
  that it calls the appropriate application to display your choice of
  file format, and that this is based on the user's MIME database,
  rather than being hardcoded.
 </p>

<p>
  If that sounds too easy, you could work with the <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" 
  href="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/yelp/">Yelp help browser</a> team

<html><![CDATA[
<p>oocalc's numeric precision is pretty awful for a load of common
functions. This should be substantially improved, in-line with
gnumeric. Functions VAR, LINEST, SKEW, PRODUCT, GEOMEAN, POWER\
at a minumum should be improved.</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
<p>For example, check out the VAR algorithm; <a STYLE="text-decoration:none"

here</a> and in fn. (ScVar). It should not discard precision in big handfulls.
To see an example of it's bad behavior enter A1: 30000 B1: 0.001 C1: =VAR(A1;A1+B1)

<?php box_sec ("Acceptance Criteria"); ?>
The functions should behave more correctly, preferably as well as

<html><![CDATA[

<p><?php rfc(2445); ?> describes a method of describing free/busy

<p> Evolution should support publishing free/busy information to an

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?> <p>

<p>
There should be a configuration control (see cal-prefs-dialog in <?php

allows the user to setup the URLs to publish to and which calendars to
use for creating the free/busy information.  There should be a
configuration option for the user to detail when they want their
calendar published, ie "Every Day", and Evolution should endeavor to
do this.  There should also be a menu option added to the calendar to
allow the user to publish the information whenever desired.
</p>

<p>
  To actually obtain the free/busy information, you simply need to call
e_cal_get_free_busy in <?php bonsai("evolution-data-server/calendar/libecal"); ?>, 
see calendar-commands.c in  <?php bonsai ("evolution/calendar/gui/"); ?> for an example of this.

<p><?php rfc(2445); ?> describes a method of describing free/busy

obtain free/busy information from the addressbook if the vCard or LDAP
property calFBURL (described in <?php rfc(2739); ?>) is set.
</p>

<p> Evolution should support a default free/busy uri for users that do
not have the calFBURL property set.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>Add a setting to cal-prefs-dialog.c in <?php bonsai("evolution/calendar/gui/dialogs"); ?> 
so the user can specify a template uri, for instance "http://freebusyserver.org/&lt;USERNAME&gt/freebusy.ifb".
</p>

<p>
When Evolution tries to obtain free/busy information for users, it
first requests the information from the calendar it will be saving the
data to.  If that fails, it tries to find an addressbook entry for the
username and look at the calFBURL property.  The code for these things
resides in e-meeting-model.h in <?php bonsai("evolution/calendar/gui/"); ?>.  
To accomplish this bounty,
there should be a third method of obtaining the free/busy information,
namely the use of the template uri with appropriate substitution. Most
of the code that loads the calFBURL can be used again to update the
attendee's information.

<html><![CDATA[
<p>
Currently, to drag and drop a file into an Evolution message, you
must drop it outside the message body. To make it easier to
attach files via drag and drop, we would like to make the attachments
bar more visible.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
<img alt="attachments bar mockup" src="composer-attachments.gif" />
</p>

<p>
First you will need to add an arrow widget with a label saying
&quot;Show/Hide Attachments Bar (drop attachments here)&quot;. When
the arrow is pressed it should show/hide the attachment bar as shown
in the animation.
</p>

<p>
When you drag a file over that arrow or label, the attachment bar
should be shown. Note that an <u>A</u> accelerator (M-a) should toggle
the attachment bar visibility. The direction of the arrow widget
should change depending on the attachment bar visibility.
</p>

<p>
Once there are files attached, it will be indicated on the right side
by an attachment icon and a label saying: &quot;%d File(s)
Attached&quot;, where %d will be substituted by the number of attached
files to that message (as shown in the animation).
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>
<p>
This will require work in Evolution's composer (<?php
bonsai("evolution/composer");?>), which is part of the Mailer
component. You will need an understanding of Gtk+ and especially of
Gtk's drag-and-drop API.

<bug>127529</bug>
<html><![CDATA[
<p>
We would like to allow people to prepare their own message
templates. The templates will be stored in a Templates folder and may
contain patterns which will be substituted when the template is used.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>
First you will need to add a new special folder, named Templates to
the local mail folders tree (~/.evolution/mail/local). That folder
will act similar to the Drafts folder, except that it will not delete
the message template when writing of the new message/reply is sent (or
saved as a Draft).
</p>

<p>
The Action submenu in the menubar and the context popup menu in the
message list of the Templates folder will contain additional items
&quot;Default New Mail&quot; and &quot;Default Reply&quot;. When
activated, that template will become the default template which will
be used when composing a new message or replying to a message,
respectively. A &quot;Reset templates&quot; item should reset the
templates so that no template, but the original reply and new message
code will be used. In the other folders, the menubar items should be
grayed out and items should not appear in the popup menu.
</p>

<p>
Next you have to implement substitution patterns. These will be
substituted by common information like &quot;Me&quot; for user's used
account mail address, &quot;Sender&quot; for sender of a mail you are
replying to, &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Received&quot; and so on. These
should be available in the composer's menus. The mailer component
should substitute these when formatting a reply or a new message. The
composer menu will have a &quot;Save Template&quot; item, which will
save the current message to the Templates folder. The patterns should have
the case-insensitive format: ${Me}, ${Sender}, ${Date}, ...
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>
<p>
This will require work in Evolution's composer (<?php
bonsai("evolution/composer");?>), which is part of the Mailer
component. You will also need to know GtkHTML editor control API
(<?php bonsai("gtkhtml");?>).

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
<p>
<img alt="toolbar mockup" src="composer-lang.gif" />
</p>
<p>Add a pop-up menu to the toolbar. (Maybe using the flag icons from
the keyboard layout applet?) Add hooks to update the choice of
spell-check language, etc, as appropriate. Turn the strings like the
reply attribution and "Forwarded Message", etc, into special objects
so that they can be dynamically translated (the same way the signature
changes when you select a new one).</p>
<p>The user should be able to configure what languages appear in the
pop-up, and which is the default. If you receive a message with a
Content-Language header indicating a specific language, then the
composer should start with that language selected by default.</p>
<p>The switching should be implemented in a similar fashion
to the current signature switching code using gtkhtml private data.
And the current setting of the language should be exposed to the
composer through a bonobo property on the editor control.  The setting
should also be saved in the html output in a lang attribute on the
body element.

<html><![CDATA[

<p></p>

<p>Currently dragging and dropping back and forth between nautilus and
firefox is very problematic.  Bookmarks and copying actions are easily
confused with surprising results.</p>

What happens now:
<ul>
<li>Drag an image (foo.gif) from a web page  to desktop. You get a "default" 
  icon with "foo.gif" as the name. 
<li>Drag a web page link to the desktop, it makes a similar .desktop
  file, which is  probably OK in this case ("make bookmark"). But dragging it back
  either does nothing, or makes the browser load the actual .desktop
  file as plaintext.
</ul>
What we'd like to see:
</ul>
<li>
  Dragging a bookmark .desktop file to Firefox should open the url the
  bookmark file contains, not the bookmark file itself.
</li>
<li>
  Dragging an http: uri from firefox to the desktop should ask you if you
  prefer to download the file or make a bookmark point to the location.  If a
  desktop bookmark is created the resulting .desktop file should specify a
  hyperlink icon (or possibly use the shortcut icon if the link points to an
  html page).
</li>
</ul>
<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
  Add the behavior dialog and download options to Nautilus upon
  receipt drops containing http: uris.  Add code to firefox to recognize
  the difference between the various .desktop filetypes and take the
  appropriate action.
<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>
  <? bonsai ("nautilus"); ?> is where the changes related to dropping
  on the desktop will live.  Firefox will also probably need changes to

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Add image data to the icon cache]]></title> <amount>100</amount> <category>Memory</category>
<bug>169344</bug>
<html><![CDATA[
<p>For the GTK 2.6 release, a memory mappable icon cache was developed.
This allows us to avoid scanning lots of directories on the startup
of every application. However, one thing it does not do is to store
the actual icon data in a shared file. This means that common images
(consider the "x" on a close button) are duplicated many times.</p>

<p>The image cache should be modified to store the actual bytes of images
inside the cache. There is already a field for this offset; all that
needs to happen is for the generation program to be modified. A few
challenges present themselves:</p>

	<ul><li>Various byte ordering (ARGB, RBGA) are used in various
	  places. Which format should be used in the file. This
	  should be chosen as so to minimize the amount of modification
	  needed to render.</li></ul>
<p>
A solution to this problem will:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Modify gtk-update-icon-cache to include the image data</li>
	<li>Modify the theme loading code to get the image data from
	    the file</li>
	<li>Document extensions to the icon specification to freedesktop.org.</li>
</ul>

<bug>169346</bug>
<html><![CDATA[
<p>A test case is needed for Nautilus doing a long session of browsing. This
test case can be used to detect leaks, using tools such as valgrind. The
test case should use the LDTP project. It should do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Put Nautilus in the root directory (/)</li>
	<li>Spider around across different folders</li>
	<li>Use various views (browser, spatial, as icons, as a list)</li>
	<li>Be able to account for the fact that under valgrind, things
	  will not happen fast (so it must wait)</li>

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Remove duplication of desktop backgrounds]]></title> <amount>200</amount> <category>Memory</category>
<bug>169347</bug> <solved>http://bugzilla.gnome.org/attachment.cgi?id=38926</solved>
<html><![CDATA[
<p>
Right now, the background image is stored in three places:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In gnome-settings-daemon</li>
	<li>In nautilus</li>
	<li>In the X server (stored there by nautilus)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The background must be stored in one and only one location.
</p>
<p>
A solution to this bounty will:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use only (screen height) * (screen width) * sizeof (int) bytes
	  of memory for a background image.</li>
	<li>Still keep reasonable performance for icons on the desktop,
	  rubberbanding, etc.</li>

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Reduce login speed]]></title>
<amount>4500</amount> <category>Google Funded - Optimization</category>
<bug></bug>
<html><![CDATA[
The time it takes a user to login to GNOME has not changed very much
in the last five years, despite massive improvements in hardware
performance.  Some analysis has shown that login time is bounded by a
heavy I/O load.  Havoc Pennington has pointed out a 3-4 second delay
caused by GConf initialization.<p>

This bounty will go to the person (or team) who submits a
maintainer-accepted patch which results in the single largest
reduction in login time.

fontconfig]]></title> <amount>4500</amount> <category>Google
Funded - Optimization</category>
<bug>169345</bug>
<html><![CDATA[
<p>On the startup of every program, fontconfig allocates about 100 kb of data.
This data should be read from a memory mappable cache on disk. This way,
the data is shared between processes. Also, it allows more expensive
techniques to optimize the data storage.</p>

<p>A solution to this bounty will:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Create a program that generates an on-disk cache.</li>
		<li>Modify fontconfig to read from this file, allowing
		  a fallback path with the existing code.</li>

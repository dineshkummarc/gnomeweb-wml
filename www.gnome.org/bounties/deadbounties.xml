<html><![CDATA[

<p>In Evolution 2.0, users can aggregate multiple simultaneous
calendar sources into a single view.  This means that you can overlay
group calendars and other people's calendars into your own calendar
view, which helps you keep others in mind while you schedule your
life.  The various backend calendars can even be color-coded in the
calendar view.</p>

<a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="evo-webcal-1.png"><img align=right border=0 src="evo-webcal-1-small.png" alt=""></a>

<p>We would like Evolution to ship with a large number of calendars
containing the schedules for national holidays, religious holidays,
and other events of general interest.  For example, calendars of
sporting events or a Linux conference schedule would be neat.</p>

<p>Because Evolution 2.0 allows you to specify a URL to a calendar, it
is even possible for these to be hosted online and cached locally.
This might be useful for things like the GNOME release schedule.</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>

This task probably won't involve patching any existing modules, though
we will include any accepted calendars in the <? bonsai ("evolution"); ?> module.

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>

<p>Find and check the schedules for various types of events, and create a
calendar in the standard iCal format.  Submit the calendar file or
files, along with a short description, to <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" 
href="mailto:evolution-patches@ximian.com">evolution-patches@ximian.com</a>.</p>

<p>Until Evolution provides an 'Export' mechanism, the files should be
copied (if created in Evolution) from the Evolution2.0 tree, that is
<code>~/.evolution/calendar/local/OnThisComputer/"name"</code>, where
"name" is the name of the calendar you created.  If created in
Evolution 1.4, the file to copy is
<code>~/evolution/local/Calendar/subfolders/"name"</code>.</p>

The bounty for this task is per-calendar.  We will pay bounties for up

<p>The Evolution 2.0 addressbook will have a "me" concept that will
allow programs to get the contact entry that corresponds to the user.
This should be integrated across the desktop, wherever extensive user
information (name, email address, etc) is needed or entered.</p>

<p>A couple of places where other applications could use this data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web forms, via Firefox's form autofill feature.</li>
<li>Document author fields in OpenOffice.</li>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
<p>
<? bonsai ("evolution-data-server/addressbook/libebook"); ?> contains
the function <tt>e_book_get_self</tt>, which can be used to retrieve
the contact associated with the user.  From there you can use the
methods on <tt>EContact</tt> to retrieve the bits of information you
need.

<html><![CDATA[
<p>
  When editing a slide in the drawing view, it is often helpful
  to have some context. We need to add a side-pane that provides
  a scrollable vertical 'slide view' of the presentation.
</p>

<center>
<img src="OpenOffice-slidepane.gif" border=0 alt="">
</center>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
<p>It is assumed that the existing 'slide view' widget can be
re-used here, in a scroll pane.</p>

<?php box_sec ("Acceptance Criteria"); ?> 
<p>
  As the user edits a slide, its appearance in the side view should
  change at a reasonable rate.  The side view should be sensibly sized
  &amp; aesthetically pleasing. The user should be able to navigate among
  slides by selecting them in the side view.

<p>Add support in evolution for attaching files to events.</p>

<p>The iCalendar specification, <?php rfc(2445); ?>, describes a
property ATTACH (4.8.1.1) for attaching data to an iCalendar object
(event or task).  The event and task editor should allow the user to
add and remove documents and files.  It should also allow the user to
open the attached using an appropriate mime handler (similar to
Nautilus or the mail portion of evolution)</p>

<p>The following picture illustrates the point:</p>

<img src="calendar-attachments.gif">

<p>To attach file, drag it on the event. The event should draw a two
pixel black outline to give visual feedback to "drag accept". You should
also be able to attach documents with a right-click menu.  There should
be a contextual menu item to open the editor and get the list of files
and documents</p>

<?php box_sec ("Affected Modules"); ?>
<?php bonsai ("evolution-data-server"); ?><br>
<?php bonsai ("evolution"); ?>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?> 

<p>The first step is to confirm that <?php bonsai
("evolution-data-server/calendar/libical/src/libical"); ?> supports
the ATTACH property properly.  You will want to check that icalrecur.h
and icalrecur.c are adequate and that icalparser.c correctly reads in
the ATTACH property.  If it does not, you will need to correct
that.<p/>

<p>The second step is to to allow drag and drop of files on the day
view, week view and list view calendar items and the task list item
(see e-day-view.c, e-week-view.c and e-cal-list-view. in <?php bonsai
("evolution/calendar/gui"); ?>). It can accept the file uri drop, look
up the event and then attach the item.</p>

<p>The third step is to create a page containing the attachment
information for the editor, and add it to the event editor and task
editors, and example of this is recurrence-page.c in <?php bonsai
("evolution/calendar/gui/dialogs"); ?>.  There should also be an
"Attach" button that pops up a file dialog.  The page should not be
visible unless there are attachments or the user clicks the "Attach"
button.  Double clicking and attachment should allow the user to open
the item with an appropriate handler.  You might design this page
similar to the mail composer's attachment area.</p>

<p>The fourth step is to add contextual menu item, "Edit
Attachments..." that should open the editor and display the attachments page.
a similar thing is done by the "Schedule Meeting..." context item.</p>

<?php box_sec ("Pointers"); ?>

<p>
You should subscribe to the <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" 
href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/evolution-hackers">
evolution-hackers</a> mailing list, and discuss any technical issues
there.  Rodrigo Moya &lt;<a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">rodrigo@ximian.com</a>&gt; and Hans Petter Jansson 
&lt;<a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="mailto:hpj@ximian.com">hpj@ximian.com</a>&gt;
will be the primary contacts on the list for the Calendar.

<bounty> <title><![CDATA[Choice of database for contacts back-end]]></title>  <amount>250</amount> <category>Addressbook</category>
<bug>127524</bug>
<html><![CDATA[

<p>
  Some people or system administrators want to use a local address
  back-end that is not the default (db3). The most popular request is
  SQLite, but a generalized SQL interface would be best.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("How"); ?>
 

<p>
  You will need to choose or design a database schema to match the
  Evolution addressbook, and then write wrappers to translate the
  Evolution addressbook manipulation functions to your choice of
  database. It is acceptable to leave database selection as an option
  'hidden' in gconf-editor. For the implementation,
  <a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.gnome-db.org">libgda</a> seems the best choice
  for the database access part, since it allows access to many different
  database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, etc)
  and offers a rich data management API.
</p>

<?php box_sec ("Modules Affected"); ?>

You'll be working on <? bonsai ("evolution-data-server"); ?>, writing a new
addressbook backend.

<?php box_sec ("Pointers"); ?>

<ul>
<li><a STYLE="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.gnome-db.org/docs/libgda/index.html">libgda API reference</a></li>

	<h1>What is GNOME?</h1>

	<p>The GNOME Project is an effort to create a complete, free and
	easy-to-use desktop environment for users, as well as a powerful
	application development framework for software developers.</p>

	<p>GNOME is part of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">The GNU Project</a>, and
	is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
	(sometimes referred to as <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open
	Source</a>). It is included in almost every BSD and GNU/Linux distribution,
	and has been designed to run on all modern UNIX-like operating systems.</p>

	<p>The project's goals include:</p>

	<h2>Freedom</h2>

	<p>Free Software is about empowering users, and about granting them rights
	to the software they use.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The right to use the software.</li>
		
		<li>The right to redistribute the software: if you have a piece of free
		software, you can share this software with other people (no license
		fees are required).</li>
		
		<li>The right to learn from the software, including its code.</li>
		
		<li>The right to alter the software (all source code, data files,
		images are included). For example, users can improve it, extend it,
		trim it down, fix problems, learn or experiment.</li>

		<li>The right to redistribute your modified versions of the software.
		This means that once you have made changes to the software, you can
		distribute these changes to your friends, customers or anyone
		else.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These rights and freedoms are at the core of the GNOME project. Free
	Software has a number of advantages over proprietary software, such as
	rapid evolution and improvement, fast turnaround of software fixes, and
	higher quality software for users and developers.</p>
	
	<h2>Usability</h2>

	<p>Through the work of professional and volunteer usability experts, the <a
	href="http://usability.gnome.org/">GNOME Usability Project</a> aims to
	improve GNOME's user friendly face, and make the experience of using our
	software as enjoyable and natural as possible.</p>

	<h2>Internationalisation</h2>

	<p>GNOME is used, developed and documented in hundreds of countries across
	the globe, and with its cutting edge internationalization features, GNOME
	lets you work comfortably in your own language, no matter if it's Japanese,
	Russian, Swahili or English. If you speak a number of languages, you might
	want to join the <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/">GNOME
	Translation Project</a> and help out!</p>

	<h2>Accessibility</h2>

	<p>Accessibility is about enabling people with disabilities to participate
	in substantial life activities including work and the use of services,
	products and information. The <a
	href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap">GNOME Accessibility
	Project</a> is developing a rich accessibility framework to bring the GNOME
	Desktop and applications to peope with disabilities.</p>

	<h2>Developer support</h2>

	<p>The GNOME developer community is vast, tightly knit, and very friendly.
	As the emerging standard for development of modern *nix applications, GNOME
	offers a large amount of documentation and other resources to help
	developers. The GNOME libraries and infrastructure take care of most of the
	boring work for you, and let you focus on the code that makes your
	application unique. For more information, go to the <a
	href="http://developer.gnome.org/">GNOME Developer's site</a>.</p>

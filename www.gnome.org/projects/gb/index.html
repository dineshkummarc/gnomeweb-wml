<A NAME="whatis"></A>What is Gnome Basic?</H3>

	It is an embryonic attempt to provide VB compatible 
functionality for the GNOME project, particularly with respect to
office (VBA) compatibility. It is part of the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</A> desktop environment: a project
to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.&nbsp; As every
other component of GNOME, Gnome Basic is <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</A>&nbsp; (Some other people like to call this OpenSource
software) and it is licensed under the terms of the GNU <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL.</A>
<p>

<A NAME="faq"></A>Frequently Asked Questions</H3>
<ul>
<li>What about Macro virii?</li>
<pre>
		A total non-issue, gb has been designed from the ground up to
	be as secure as possible, currently the worst DoS is RAM consumption
	but this is hardly serious. The security capabilities will be updated
	as more functionality is introduced.
</pre>
<li>So how do I send a patch then?</li>
<pre>
		Please send the result of 'cvs -z3 diff -u' to me, and if
	this is your first patch a brief note saying you have read and agree
	to the terms of docs/LICENSE.
</pre>
<li>Isn't it really difficult / have you considered this aspect?</li>
<pre>
		Not really and yes many aspects have been considered others
	we do not wish to consider yet. If you can see some great pit we are
	falling into send a patch. The scale of the project is large but this
	is not scary.
</pre>
<li>I use VB a lot and really want to speed up GB developement, how can I help?</li>
<pre>
		If you are an ace VB coder but cannot code in C there is a
	limited role for you. If you feel you wish to learn C pick an item from
	the ( expanding ) TODO, implement it, and send me a patch. However, there 
	is room for a competant VB programmer to expand the regression test 
	suite to exercise all the new features that gb implements. All patches
	welcome.
</pre>
<!--
<li>Here is my great idea!</li>
<pre>
		Please do not send me your great idea, I have a number of
	them myself, instead code your idea into a 500 line prototype and
	send me a patch to evaluate.
</pre>
-->
<li>Why don't you just translate to Python? Python is great ...</li>
<pre>
		It is my opinion that translating to Python will sacrifice
	exporting to VB and will in the long run cause serious compatibility
	problems that are not evidant if you control the interpreter.

		Futhermore, it is possible to have a Python 'backend' if you
	so desire but in reality a total waste of time since the interpreter
	will provide equivilant functionality and the C backend eventualy
	will provide faster functionality.
</pre>
<li>Why is GB written in C?</li>
<pre>
		C is a great language for writing low level functionality
	in. For example, Python is written in C, GCC's C++ compiler is written
	in C. C is portable, standardized, lucid and powerful. GB is however
	written in an object oriented fashion using the Gtk Object model.
</pre>
<li>What License is GB under? </li>
<pre>
		Essentialy GPL for core and LGPL for runtime. Please read
	gb/docs/LICENSE before you contribute code, as we reserve the right
	to switch code between the GPL and the LGPL.
</pre>

<A NAME="screenshots"></A>Screenshots</H3>
Just to whet your apetite there is a simple number game test in CVS that
so far appears to work quite nicely. Here is a <a href="gnome-basic.jpeg">
photograph</a> of it running.<P>
Here is the fruit of the project work, loading a shed load of <a
href="gb-tc-vbp.jpeg">forms</a> at once.

<A NAME="lists"></A>Mailing lists</H3>

The <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gb/">Gnome Basic 
mailing list</A> can be reached at <A HREF="mailto:gb@ximian.com">
gb@ximian.com</A>.  If you want to subscribe to the mailing list please 
fill out <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gb/">the 
subscription form</A>. Also if you could please check the <A 
HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gb/">Gnome Basic archives</A> 
for an answer to your question before posting your query it would be greatly 
appreciated. 

Please read some <A HREF="../gnumeric/mailing-list.html">advice</A> before sending mail.<p>

	The project is still in a very pre-alpha stage, hence be
kind in your critique. Furthermore any comments of a non technical
nature only serve to waste valuable developer time. This list is
intended for technical developer discussion, preferably with patches.<p>

<H3>
<A NAME="getting"></A>Getting Gnome Basic</H3>

As with any other software in GNOME, you can fetch the latest
development version of Gnome Basic from the <a
href="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">GNOME Anonymous
CVS</A> and from the GNOME CVS. Just checkout the module "gb".<p> CVS can
also be browsed from <A HREF="http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/gb/">
http://cvs.gnome.org/lxr/source/gb</a>.<p>

A tentative preliminary, development release is available at <a href=
"ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gb/">
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gb/</a>

<H3>
<A NAME="support"></A>Contractual Support</h3>

If you are interested in contracting support for Gnome Basic, please
check the <a href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian Inc.</a> web page.<p>

All the code written by Ximian is released under the terms of the GNU
GPL.  If the code extension is general enough your extension might be
folded into the main Gnome Basic distribution. 
<p>
<H3>
<A NAME="bugs"></A>Reporting Bugs</H3>

We are very interested in grammar / parser bugs, since these usually point
to features we havn't thought about yet, and affect the core design. We
are less interested in general bug reports, since development is proceeding
apace. Also security bugs are of great interest, please report these. Try to
make sure that you have the latest version of gb before reporting a bug
since many bugs are silently fixed.

<P>The standard procedure for bug reporting is detailed at <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/">http://bugs.gnome.org/</A> please ensure that
your bug hasn't already been logged by checking the <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgb.html">list</A>.

<P>There are certain types of bug that we are especially interested in. GB
should <b>never</b> die (SEGV) if it does please, please put the effort in 
to submit a bug report, it will save others lots of grief. Also, if you
see any gaping security holes, we would be most interested.

<H3>
<A NAME="thanks">Developers</a></H3>

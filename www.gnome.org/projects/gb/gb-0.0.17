Gnome Basic 0.0.17 released

	Helix Code, in conjunction with various merry men are most
proud to announce a post Christmas[1] version of gb, with the fruits
of the season included.

* What did you do this time ?

	* Delay the parsing of the function specs until the function
	is used for the first time - speed and efficiency win (Frank)

	* Options setup and honoured (Ken Guest)

	* Lots of Command button signals added (Almer Tigelaar)

	* Build fix (Boszormenyi Zoltan)

	* Date functions fixed up (Ravi)

	* 'For Each' implemented (Rest by me)

	* UBound, LBound

	* More constants added

	* Screen's mouse pointer manipulation stuff impl

	* Object referencing grammar fixed

	* User defined constants implemented

	* Exit [Sub, Function, For etc.] impl.

	* Fix function invocation with Option Explicit

	* Parse Declare statements

	* ReDim implemented

	* Correct spelling of indices discovered.

	* New object globalization logic

* Notes

	Bug reports are only appreciated for parser errors, ie. if
you are interested in development please send either patches, or
fragments of test code. We are well aware that there are many things
remaining unimplemented.

	We need someone to start tackling the pandemic of memory leaks
in gb, before other modules start catching them.

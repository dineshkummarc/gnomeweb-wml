<h1>Snack-size Nautilus Hacks</h1>

This is a list of some Nautilus hacks that would be nice to have for
2.6.  They aren't really bite-size - a list of bite-sized tasks would
be too hard to maintain.  These tasks will take a certain amount of
research and planning, and will almost certainly need a few rounds of
review to get right.

<h2>Selection-sensitive side pane</h2> 

The side pane is currently geared toward showing information about the
current directory.  It would be nice for it to try to show more about the 
selected files.  Some possibilities:

<ul>
<li>Show a "zoomed in" version of each file in the Information side pane.  Show all of the information types from the Icon Captions for each selected file.</i>
<li>Maybe provide all of the Open As actions on the side pane for the selected files</li>
<li>Change the notes pane to show notes for selected files instead of just the current file/directory.  This will make notes much more useful.</li>
</ul>
Things and files to look at:
<ul>
<li>Nautilus file attributes, and reading them asynchronously.  See <i>nautilus/docs/nautilus-io.txt</i></li>
<li>Registering for and receiving selection change notifications, <i>nautilus/libnautilus/nautilus-view.h</i>, <i>nautilus/src/nautilus-window-manage-views.c (change_selection)</i>
<li><i>nautilus/src/nautilus-information-panel.c</i></li>
<li><i>nautilus/components/notes/</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Rearrangable list-view columns</h2>

This would have two parts: First, all of the things that you can show
as icon captions in the icon view should be made available as list view
columns.  Second, there should be a way to edit which columns are
available.  There is a column editor in libegg, this could probably be
integrated.  Or maybe the columns could use the same choices/priorities
as the icon view.

Things and files to look at:
<ul>
<li>Nautilus file attributes, and reading them asynchronously.  See <i>nautilus/docs/nautilus-io.txt</i></li>
<li><i>libegg/libegg/column-chooser/</i></li>
<li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-list-view.c</i></li>
<li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-list-model.c</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive permissions</h2>

The way MacOSX does this makes sense - they have a button underneath
the permissions that says "Apply to Folder Contents" or something like
that.

<a
href="http://primates.ximian.com/~dave/screenshots/Screenshot-Nautilus-PermCustom.png">This
screenshot</a> shows a possible new layout for permissions.  One
benefit of this layout is that "Read And Write" is more easy to apply
recursively, because a Read and Write file should probably be +rw,
while a Read and Write directory should probably be +rwx.

Things and files to look at:

<ul>
<li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-properties-window.c</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Glob Selection Dialog</h2>

People want to be able to perform operations on sets of files.  Rather
than implement filtering, we want to implement a simple dialog that
lets users specify a pattern to search for.  When they're done, the
file window should select all files that match this pattern.

<p>
Things and files to look at:

<ul>
<li><i>nautilus/src/file-manager/fm-directory-view.c</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Range Selection</h2>

In the icon view, you should be able to click on one file, then click
on another file (holding some keyboard modifier) to select all the
files between them, inclusive.  You'll need to figure out the best
modifier (the ui team can probably comment on that).

<p>
Things and files to look at:
<ul>
<li><i>nautilus/libnautilus-private/nautilus-icon-container.c</i></li>
</ul>

<h2>Per-window Hidden Prefs</h2>

Whether to show hidden files should be a per-window preference rather
than a global one.  <i>mathieu is planning to work on this</i>

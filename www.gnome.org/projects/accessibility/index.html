          The GNOME Accessibility project develops and fosters
	  compelling free open source accessibility solutions for
	  graphical user interfaces.  Through a worldwide community of
	  developers and users, we continue to empower everyone,
	  regardless of physical or mental abilities.</p>

          <p>In GNOME, accessibility is a core value that touches all
          aspects of the system.  With a model of "built in" versus
          "bolted on", the GNOME Accessibility project has helped lead
          the industry in accessible design.  From the infrastructure,
          to the graphical toolkit, to the applications, to the
          assistive technologies, accessibility has been a central
          consideration from the very early days.  As a result, GNOME
          not only has compelling accessibility today, but it also
          provides a rich and stable base for future accessibility
          work.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, through the generous contributions of
          volunteers on the <a href="http://l10n.gnome.org/">GNOME
          Translation Teams</a>, GNOME has been translated to many of
          the world's languages.  As a result, people with
          disabilities around the world, who are often the people who
          can least afford commercial operating systems and
          accessibility solutions, can have access to a modern
          graphical desktop at only the cost of the hardware.</p>

          <h2>GNOME Outreach Program: Accessibility</h2>
          <p>There are a number
          of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/">GNOME
          Outreach Program: Accessibility</a> opportunities for you to
	  join the GNOME Accessibility project and receive a cash reward.</p>

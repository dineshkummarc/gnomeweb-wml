	  <h1>What is Accessibility?</h1>
          <p><img src="images/logo.png" width="70" height="70"
	  hspace="5" align="left" alt="Universal access logo"/>
	  Providing accessibility means removing barriers that prevent
	  people with disabilities from participating in substantial
	  life activities, including the use of services, products,
	  and information. We see and use a multitude of
	  access-related technologies in everyday life, many of which
	  we may not recognize as disability related when we encounter
	  them. The bell that chimes when an elevator is about to
	  arrive, for example, was designed with blind people in
	  mind. The curb cut ramps common on street corners in the
	  United States were introduced for wheelchair
	  users. Accessibility is by definition a category of
	  usability: software that is not accessible to a particular
	  user is not usable by that person. As with any usability
	  measure, accessibility is necessarily defined relative to
	  user task requirements and needs. For example, a telephone
	  booth is accessible (e.g., usable) to a blind person, but
	  may not be accessible to a person using a
	  wheelchair. Graphical user interfaces are not very
	  accessible to blind users, but relatively accessible to deaf
	  users.</p>

	  <p>Assistive access means that system infrastructure allows
	  add-on assistive software to transparently provide
	  specialized input and output capabilities. For example,
	  screen readers allow blind users to navigate through
	  applications, determine the state of controls, and read text
	  via text to speech conversion. On-screen keyboards replace
	  physical keyboards, and head-mounted pointers replace
	  mice. These are only a few of the assistive technologies
	  users may add on to their systems.</p>

          <h1 class="headerTitle">GNOME Accessibility Leadership</h1>
	  <p>To be filled out.  Need a section on the overall
	  leadership of the GNOME Accesibility project.  I (Willie
	  Walker) am reluctant to put my name here, but I am
	  continually requested to do so.  If my name goes here, I
	  also need to get the names of people and organizations that
	  have contributed past and present.</p>

	  <h1>Types of Disabilities</h1>
	  <p>Many people are born with a disability, while many others
	  find that diminishing physical or mental abilities occur
	  naturally over time, or as the result of accidents or
	  diseases. Sometimes these changes can be temporary,
	  sometimes permanent. Basic life activities include taking
	  care of oneself, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking,
	  learning, working, performing manual tasks, participating in
	  community events and activities, and breathing.</p>

	  <p>The following disabilities can make using computers challenging.</p>

	  <h2>Visual impairments</h2>
	  <p>From low vision to blindness, the range of visual
	  limitations is broad. Symptoms of low vision include
	  dimness, haziness, extreme far-sightedness or
	  near-sightedness, color blindness, and tunnel vision, among
	  others. People with these disabilities are concerned with
	  being able to see text or images on a computer screen and
	  being able to perform tasks that require eye-hand
	  coordination, such as moving a computer mouse. Text size and
	  color can make a big difference in legibility for people who
	  have low vision.</p>

	  <h2>Mobility impairments</h2>
	  <p>Mobility impairments can be caused by arthritis, stroke,
	  cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and
	  loss of limbs or digits, among others. Poor muscle control
	  or weaknesses can make using standard keyboards and mouse
	  devices difficult. For instance, some people are unable to
	  type two keys simultaneously, while others tend to hit
	  multiple keys or to bounce keys when pressing or releasing
	  them. People who are able to use only one hand likewise have
	  difficulties with some keyboard and mouse tasks.</p>

	  <h2>Hearing impairments</h2>
	  <p>People with hearing impairments may be able to hear some
	  sound, but may not be able to distinguish words. Other
	  people may not be able to hear sound at all. Not being able
	  to hear computer prompts, like beeps and spoken messages,
	  can be problematic for these individuals. 

          <h2>Cognitive and language impairments</h2>
          <p>Cognitive and language impairments
	  range from dyslexia to difficulties remembering, solving
	  problems, or perceiving sensory information to problems
	  comprehending and using language. For people with these
	  impairments, things like complex or inconsistent displays or
	  word choice can make using computers more difficult.</p>

	  <h2>Seizure disorders</h2>
	  <p>Specific patterns of light or sound can trigger epileptic
	  seizures in some susceptible individuals.</p>

	  <h2>Age-related impairments</h2>
	  <p>The most common problem people face as they age is the
	  natural deterioration of eyesight. By age 65, most people
	  have lost at least some of their ability to focus, resolve
	  images, distinguish colors and adapt to changes in light. As
	  part of the natural aging process and longevity, the need
	  for contrast increases because of discoloration in the eye
	  fluids and lens. Most people have a loss in color perception
	  that accompanies their dimmed vision. With longevity, people
	  often experience other degenerative effects as well. Varying
	  degrees of hearing loss are common, as is difficulty with
	  small motor coordination, often due to arthritis or
	  stiffening of the joints.</p>

	  <h1>Assistive Technology for Computers</h1>
	  <p>Assistive technology, also called accessibility aids, are
	  added to computers by people who use them to make computers
	  more accessible. Some common aids include the following:</p>

          <p><strong>Screen magnifiers</strong> help people with low
          vision. These utilities are like a magnifying glass. People
          using them are able to control what area of the computer
          screen they want enlarged, and can move that focus to view
          different areas of the screen. They are also known as screen
          enlargers or large print programs.</p>

	  <p><strong>Screen readers</strong> are for people who are
	  blind. These aids make on-screen information available as
	  synthesized speech or a refreshable Braille display. They
	  can only translate text based information. Graphics can be
	  translated if there is alternative text describing the
	  visual images. They are also known as blind access utilities
	  or screen reviewers.</p>

	  <p><strong>On-screen keyboards</strong> are used by people
	  who are unable to use a standard keyboard. An on-screen
	  keyboard lets people select keys using a pointing method
	  such as pointing devices, switches, or Morse-code input
	  systems.</p>

          <p><strong>Keyboard enhancement utilities</strong> are used
          by people who have trouble typing and controlling a
          mouse. They allow the user to perform complicated key
          sequences serially (e.g. Control-C), control the mouse
          pointer and buttons from the keyboard, and set the key
          repeat and acceptance rates. These ehancements are built
          into the base platform and are known as AccessX on
          Solaris/Linux, <a href="/AccessPac">AccessPac</a> on Microsoft
          Windows, and <a href="/EasyAccess">EasyAccess</a> on the
          Mac.</p>

	  <p><strong>Speech recognition</strong> programs are
	  primarily used by people with mobility impairments. These
	  utilities enable people to control computers with their
	  voice instead of a mouse or keyboard. They are also known
	  speech recognition programs.</p>

	  <p><strong>Alternative input devices</strong> allow
	  individuals to control their computers through means other
	  than a standard keyboard or pointing device. Examples
	  include smaller or larger keyboards, eye-gaze pointing
	  devices, and sip-and-puff systems controlled by breathing.</p>

	  <p>The following is a larger list af assistive technologies
	  broken down by the disability type who benefits from
	  them.</p>

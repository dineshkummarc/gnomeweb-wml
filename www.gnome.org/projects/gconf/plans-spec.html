  <h1>Sketchy Specification for a Future Configuration System</h1>

  <p>This specification is intended to cover the existing functionality of gconf plus
  the delta described in <a href="plans.html">these notes</a>.</p>

  <h2>Big Picture Concepts</h2>

  <p>
  The core concept of the configuration system is a global, hierarchical tree 
  of key-value pairs, similar to a filesystem. "Global" means that each tree is 
  shared across multiple processes. However, there are multiple trees and trees
  can be combined to get a "search path" effect where values are looked for 
  in multiple places.
  </p>

  <p>
  By default, there are two systemwide trees and a tree for each user. The
  systemwide trees are a set of <i>default</i> settings and a tree of
  <i>mandatory</i> settings. System daemons not associated with a user session 
  will look up values in these two trees. A program in a user session will 
  look up values first in the mandatory tree, then in the user's tree, then 
  in the default tree.
  </p>

  <p>
  Local sites may add additional trees of values, for example one associated
  with a workgroup or geographical region of the company.
  </p>

  <p>

  Again, the system daemon looks at the default and mandatory trees, and the
  user daemon uses these same trees with a per-user tree inserted. This is
  important because it means that if nobody is logged in, the value used will be
  the default setting that a new user would get. 
  </p>

  <h2>Application Developer API</h2>

  <p>
  The first step in adding configuration to an application is to create 
  <i>schemas</i> for the application's settings. Schemas are XML files 
  describing configuration keys. Each schemas file may describe multiple
  keys, and the information for each key should include:
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>
  The type of the key's value in D-BUS type signature format.
  </li>
  <li>
  A relative-to-some-root name for the key. All keys in a schemas file
  should assume the same root. For example a schemas file may describe the 
  keys that make up a "panel applet", and the schema can be instantiated under
  distinct roots for each applet.
  </li>
  <li>
  Localized short and long descriptions of the setting.
  </li>
  <li>
  A default value for the setting.
  </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  In addition to the per-key information, the schemas file should somehow
  indicate which roots are expected to be used. For example, it might say that
  "any subdirectory of /org/gnome/panel/applets/ gets these schemas" or for the
  global panel settings "these schemas apply to the root /org/gnome/panel" - the
  exact syntax here doesn't matter, I think only the two cases of "any subroot
  of /foo..."  and "exactly the root /foo" are interesting. Arbitrary globbing
  could be allowed but I don't know the use case. The purpose of this feature
  is to support a gconf-editor type thing.
  </p>

  <p>
  Unlike gconf, in this new configuration system the schemas are not stored in
  the configuration tree itself; schemas are instead a property of the
  application. Applications install their XML files to a global schemas
  directory, and installed schemas can be referenced by a URI identifier.  In
  other words there's a sort of catalog mapping unique URIs to schemas files.
  gconf-editor would want to list all the URIs and look up the schemas for 
  each; individual applications probably use only a few of the schemas files.
  The URIs here would use a domain owned by the schemas file author, as with 
  XML DTDs.
  </p>

  <p>
  The schemas directory should really be multiple directories following the 
  basedir specification.
  </p>

  <p>
  The API for apps should involve creating a settings object, with some 
  schemas URI, at some root in the configuration hierarchy. The app should 
  also specify whether the per-user settings should be included.
  </p>
  <pre>
  class Settings
  {
    enum { SCOPE_SYSTEM, SCOPE_USER } Scope;
 
    Settings (Scope scope, String schemas_uri_identifier, 
              String root_directory);

    Variant Get (String relative_key);
    void    Set (String relative_key, Variant value);
  }
  </pre>

  <p>
  The settings object should also have a way to subscribe to change 
  notifications below the given root_directory. There probably is not 
  a use case for subscribing to changes in more detail than that.
  </p>

  <p>
  The change notification should include the relative name of the changed key,
  its new value, whether the key is currently set (or just derived from 
  the schemas), and whether the key is currently writable. This should 
  be done by passing an object to the change notification that includes 
  all of this information (so the change notification callback just has 
  one "entry" object as argument). This lets us add more fields to an 
  "entry" in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Settings object should automatically force conformance to the schemas:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Keys not found in the schemas should be hidden.</li>
  <li>Keys set to a different type than found in the schemas should be treated
  as unset.</li>
  <li>Unset keys should behave as if set to the default found in the schema.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  It's an essential optimization for apps to avoid loading the localized short
  and long descriptions, as these are huge and used only by gconf-editor style
  tools.  An mmap() cache of schemas used by apps is one approach. I think
  putting descriptions in separate files manually is a bad idea since it will
  lead to developers not keeping them updated.
  </p>
 
  <p>
   gconf-editor/regedit sort of tools would not use the same API as
   applications.  They would have a "no schemas" or "raw" mode of loading
   configuration settings, an API for listing and loading schemas, and a way to
   edit config trees or parts of trees other than the current user's
   tree. API for all this should probably be kept clearly separate from 
   the normal application API.
  </p>

  <h2>Implementation</h2> 

  <p>

  The implementation should be a daemon that implements interfaces provided via
  D-BUS. The daemon should be able to run either systemwide or in a user session and 
  should thus be written in paranoid/untrusting style.

  </p>
  
  <p>
  
  The only really hard question about the D-BUS interface is how to do
  notifications such that apps only hear about the changes that matter to 
  them. Otherwise each setting change wakes up all apps. The two approaches
  are to map each key in the configuration hierarchy to a D-BUS object path 
  so D-BUS signals can be filtered by source object; or to have apps 
  tell the conf daemon which signals to emit, and adjust dbus to support
  multicast (vs. broadcast) signals.
  
  </p>

  <p>

  It's critical that the conf daemon have no state. If the daemon goes down, 
  apps should re-establish their state with the daemon, rather than the daemon
  restoring its own state.  

  </p>

  <p>

  The daemon should store data in a nice XML format, it need not be the same as
  the current one. Can't be in fact due to using dbus types.

  </p>
  
  <p>
  The daemon should have an extensible configuration file. This would allow
  among other things dynamically constructing a configuration tree based on 
  the context (e.g. hostname) of the particular user session.
  </p>

  <h2>Transition/back-compat with respect to GConf</h2> 

  <p>
  One option is that the new daemon has an alternate backend that reads settings
  from the current gconf database, especially ~/.gconf. If this database is
  present, then settings from it would be read in. The pain in this case is 
  writing this backend and mapping old gconf settings to the new system.
  </p>

  <p>
  The second option is a framework allowing apps to provide a one-time
  upgrade/migration script. The framework would deal with running this 
 once for each app, when appropriate, and have features to make it easy 
 to write the script (e.g. quickly say "old key foo goes to new key bar")
  </p>

  <h2>Stuff to Punt</h2>

  <p>
  Some notable things that don't need to be in 1.0.
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>Transactions. Nice in theory, but we've been fine without them 
  in gconf, and supporting complex types already helps a lot.
  </li>
  <li>Most of the GConf API can die. We don't need a GConfValue, 
  the split between Engine/Client is pointless, GConfSchema goes away 
  except in the gconf-editor oriented "load all schemas" type of API,
  GConfChangeSet goes away since we're not doing transactions.
  </li>
  <li>
  "Direct" (no daemon) access can go away, its use case is covered by 
  the systemwide daemon or worst case by a private API used only by the 
  official command line tool coming with the config system. Maybe 
  eventually we also want this for some "one-time" apps that don't persist 
  and thus don't need notifications, but since dbus is starting pretty early 
  in boot it's unclear this is genuinely useful. Just use some simple
  existing config files for early boot stuff.
  </li>
  </ul>

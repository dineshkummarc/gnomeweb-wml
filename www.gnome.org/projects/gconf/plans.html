<h1>GConf future improvements</h1>

<p><a href="index.html">Overview of GConf</a>.
</p>

<p>A summer 2002 OLS paper on GConf future is <a href="gconf-OLS-2002.pdf">here</a>,
it's a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
Some changes since then:
<ul>
<li>Ettore, Jeff, and others convinced me that we need to be able to 
store non-preferences data such as the address book. 
To that end, we need to have stronger guarantees of robustness, 
better efficiency for large data collections, etc.
<li>
<li>For desktop-independence, 
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/">D-BUS</a> may be 
useful if KDE supports it. D-BUS also addresses some of the needs
of a client-server architecture outlined in the 
<a href="gconf-OLS-2002.pdf">OLS paper</a>.
</li>
<li>
We should support having the apps load .schemas files directly for 
emergency fallback values when nothing is set in the gconf server.
</li>
<li>
I posted some <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gconf-list/2003-May/msg00000.html">random API thoughts</a>.
</li>
<li>
I'd go ahead and use GLib etc. in the API, and standardize with other desktops
on the D-BUS protocol level, if we can get D-BUS (or equivalent) adopted.
</li>
</ul>

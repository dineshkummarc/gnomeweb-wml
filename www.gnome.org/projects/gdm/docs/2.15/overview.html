        Interface Stability
      </span></h2><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The key/value pairs defined in the GDM configuration files and
        the location of these files are considered "stable" interfaces
        and should only change in ways that are backwards compatible.  Note that
        this includes functionality like the GDM scripts (Init, PreSession,
        PostSession, PostLogin, XKeepsCrashing, etc.); directory locations
        (ServAuthDir, PidFile, etc.), system applications (SoundProgram), etc.
        Some configuration values depend on OS interfaces may need to be
        modified to work on a given OS.  Typical examples are HaltCommand,
        RebootCommand, SuspendCommand, StandardXServer, Xnest, SoundProgram,
        and the "command" value for each "server-foo".
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        Note: distributions often change the default values of keys to support
        their platform.  Command-line interfaces for GDM programs installed to
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">&lt;bin&gt;</span> and <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">&lt;sbin&gt;</span>
        are considered stable.  Refer to your distribution documentation to see
        if there are any distribution-specific changes to these GDM interfaces
        and what support exists for them.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        If issues are discovered that break compatibility, please file a bug

        The GDM daemon is responsible for managing displays on the system.
        This includes authenticating users, starting the user session, and
        terminating the user session.  GDM is configurable and the ways it can
        be configured are described in the "Configuring GDM" section
        of this document.  The <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">Init</span>,
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PostLogin</span>, <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PreSession</span>, 
        and <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PostSession</span> scripts discussed below are 
        discussed in this "Configuring GDM section".
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The GDM daemon supports a UNIX domain socket protocol which can be used
        to control aspects of its behavior and to query information.  This
        protocol is described in the "Controlling GDM" section of
        this document.  
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM can be asked to manage a display a number of ways.  Local displays
        are always managed when GDM starts and will be restarted when a user's
        session is finished.  Displays can be requested via XDMCP, flexible
        displays can be requested by running the
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> command.  Displays that are started
        on request are not restarted on session exit.  GDM also provides the
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmdynamic</span> command to allow easier management of
        displays on a multi-user server.  These display types are discussed
        further in the next section.  
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        When the GDM daemon is asked to manage a display, it will fork an
        X server process, then run the <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">Init</span> script as the
        root user, and start the login GUI dialog as a slave process on the
        display.  GDM can be configured to use either
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmgreeter</span> (the default) or
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmlogin</span> as the GUI dialog program.  The
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmlogin</span> program supports accessibility while the
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmgreeter</span> program supports greater themeability.
        The GUI dialog is run as the unpriviledged "gdm" user/group
        which is described in the "Security" section below.  The GUI
        dialog communicates with the daemon via a sockets protocol and via
        standard input/output.  The slave, for example passes the username and
        password information to the GDM daemon via standard input/output so
        the daemon can handle the actual authentication.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The login GUI dialog screen allows the user to select which session
        they wish to start and which language they wish to use.  Sessions are
        defined by files that end in the .desktop extension and more
        information about these files can be found in the
        "Configuration" section.  The user enters their name and
        password and if these successfully authenticate, GDM will start the
        requested session for the user.  It is possible to configure GDM to
        avoid the authentication process by turning on the Automatic or Timed
        Login features in the GDM configuration.  The login GUI can also be
        configured to provide additional features to the user, such as the
        Face Browser; the ability to halt, restart, or suspend the system;
        and/or edit the login configuration (after entering the root password).
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para"> 
        GDM, by default, will use Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) for
        authentication, but can also support regular crypt and shadow passwords
        on legacy systems.  After authenticating a user, the daemon runs the
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PostLogin</span> script as root, and forks a slave
        process to start the requested session.  This slave process runs the
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PreSession</span> script as root, sets up the users
        environment, and starts the requested session.  GDM keeps track of the
        user's default session and language in the user's
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">~/.dmrc</span> and will use these defaults if the user
        did not pick a session or language in the login GUI.  On Solaris, GDM
        (since version 2.8.0.3) uses the SDTLOGIN interface after user
        authentication to tell the X server to be restarted as the user instead
        of as root for added security.  When the users session exits, the GDM
        daemon will run the <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PostSession</span> script as root.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="displaytypes"/><h2 class="sect2 title"><span class="title"><span class="label">2.4. </span>Different Display Types</span></h2><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM supports three different display types: static (local) displays,
        flexible (on-demand) displays, and XDMCP (remote) displays.  The
        "X Server Definitions" and the "Local Static X Display
        Configuration" subsections of the "Configuration"
        section explains how these various types of displays are defined in
        the GDM configuration file.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        Local static displays are always started by the daemon, and when they
        die or are killed, they are restarted.  GDM can run as many of these
        as needed.  GDM can also manage displays on which it does not manage a
        GUI login, thus GDM can be used for supporting X terminals.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        Flexible, or on demand displays, are started via the socket protocol
        with the <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> command.  This feature is
        only available to users logged in on the console and will display a new
        login screen.  If a flexible display has previously been started on
        the console, running <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> again will
        display a menu allowing users to switch back to a previous session
        or start a new flexible session.  The <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span>
        locks the current session before starting a new flexible display, so
        the user's password must be entered before returning to an existing
        session.  The <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> command can also be
        used to launch nested <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">Xnest</span> display.  These are
        launched in a window in the user's current session.  Nested displays
        can be started even if not logged into the console and are started by 
        running the <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver -n</span> command.  Flexible
        displays are not restarted when the user session ends.  Flexible
        displays require virtual terminal (VT) support in the kernel, and will
        not be available if not supported (such as on Solaris).  Nested
        displays require that the X server supports Xnest.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The last display type is the XDMCP remote displays which are described
        in the next section.  Remote hosts can connect to GDM and present the
        login screen if this is enabled.  Some things are different for
        remote sessions.  For example, the Actions menu which allows you to
        shut down, restart, suspend, or configure GDM are not shown.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        Displays started via the <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmdynamic</span> command are
        treated as local displays, so they are restarted automatically on
        when the session exits.  This command is intended to more effectively
        manage the displays on a multi-user server (many displays connected
        to a single server).

        XDMCP support is turned off, but can be enabled if desired.  If GDM is
        built with TCP Wrapper support, then the daemon will only grant access

        Starting such a session allows the user to enter the name or the
        address of the host on which to connect; provided the said host runs an
        SSH server, the user then gets connected to the server on which the

        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">PreFetchProgram</span> configuration variable so that the
        <span class="command" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmprefetch</span> program is called with the default
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmprefetchlist</span> file.  The default
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmprefetchlist</span> file was optimized
        for a GNOME desktop running on Solaris, so may need fine-tuning on
        other systems.  Alternative prefetchlist files can be contributed
        to the "gdm" category in
        <a class="ulink" href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/" title="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">bugzilla.gnome.org</a>,
        so that they can be included in future GDM releases.

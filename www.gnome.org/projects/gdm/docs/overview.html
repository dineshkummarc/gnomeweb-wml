        GDM is a replacement for XDM, the X Display Manager. Unlike its
        competitors (X3DM, KDM, WDM) GDM was written from scratch and does not
        contain any original XDM / X Consortium code.

        GDM was written with simplicity and security in mind. The overall
        design concept is this: 
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para"> 
        Upon startup the <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdm</span> daemon parses its config file
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdm.conf</span>.  For each of the local displays
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdm</span> forks an Xserver and a slave process.  The
        main <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdm</span> process will then listen to XDMCP
        requests, if so configured, from remote displays and monitor the local
        display sessions.  The main daemon process will also allow starting of
        on new local Xservers on demand using the
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> command.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para"> 
        The <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdm</span> slave process opens the display and starts
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmlogin</span>, the graphical login application.
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmlogin</span> runs as a dedicated user and communicates
        asynchronously with the slave process through a pipe.  Alternatively
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmgreeter</span> command can be used which is the same
        as <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmlogin</span> but allows greater themability.
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmgreeter</span> is referred to as the Themed
        Greeter, while <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmlogin</span> is refereed to as the

        GDM relies heavily on the presence of PAM, Pluggable Authentication
        Modules, but supports regular crypt() and shadow passwords on legacy
        systems.

        Remote displays can connect to the XDMCP port on the GDM host.
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdm</span> will grant access to hosts specified in the
        GDM service section in your TCP Wrappers configuration file. GDM does
        not support remote display access control on systems without TCP
        Wrappers.  XDMCP support can be turned off completely, however.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM includes several measures making it more resistant to denial of
        service attacks on the XDMCP service. A lot of the protocol parameters,
        handshaking timeouts etc. can be fine tuned. The defaults should work
        for most systems, however.  Don't change them unless you know what
        you are doing.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        In general GDM is very reluctant regarding reading/writing of user
        files.  For instance it refuses to touch anything but regular files.
        Links, sockets and devices are ignored.  The value of the
        RelaxPermissions parameter determines whether GDM should accept files
        writable by the user's group or others.  These are ignored by default.

        All operations on user files are done with the effective user id of the
        user.  If the sanity check fails on the user's
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">.Xauthority</span> file, a fallback cookie is created in
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/tmp</span>.

        Note that normally it is assumed that the home directory is only
        readable by the user.  However NFS traffic really goes "over the wire"
        and thus can be snooped.  For setups with NFS directories you should
        really use the <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">UserAuthDir</span> and set it to some
        local directory such as <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/tmp</span>.  GDM will try to
        open the normal authorization file for reading as root, and if it
        fails, then it will conclude that it is on an NFS mount and it will
        automatically use <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">UserAuthFBDir</span>, which is usually
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/tmp</span>.  This can be changed by setting
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">NeverPlaceCookiesOnNFS</span> in the
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">[security]</span> section to false.

        GDM implements only the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authorization scheme, see
        the XDMCP section for more information about this, especially relating

        Finally, the sysadmin can specify the maximum file size GDM should
        accept, and, if the face browser is enabled, a tunable maximum icon
        size is also enforced.  On large systems it is still advised to turn
        off the face browser for performance reasons. Looking up icons in
        homedirs, scaling and rendering face icons can take quite a long time.
        YMMV.

        GDM also has a unix domain socket which can be used to control
        certain aspects of behavior, or to query information about running
        servers or logged in users.  This is the
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/tmp/.gdm_socket</span> and the protocol is described
        in the sources in the <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">daemon/gdm.h</span> header file.
        The <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> command uses this for example
        to launch on demand X servers for the user.

        GDM allows 3 different display types.  First local static X servers.
        These are always run, and when they die or are killed, they are
        restarted.  GDM can run as many of these as needed.  GDM can also
        manage servers on which it does not manage a login itself, thus
        allowing GDM to be used when building X terminals.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        Next GDM supports flexible or on demand servers.  These are run by
        requesting one using the socket protocol.  There is a command,
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span>, which can do this for the user. 
        For standard X servers the user must be logged in from a console, on
        one of the servers that GDM has run.  This command can however also
        launch nested <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">Xnest</span> servers which can be started
        even from non-console logins.  This is generally done by running
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver -n</span>.  These servers
        are not restarted when the user session ends.  
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">gdmflexiserver</span> normally also locks the users
        screen before running a new server with xscreensaver.

        Last display type is the XDMCP remote displays that are described in
        the next section.  Remote hosts can connect to GDM and present the
        login screen if this is enabled.  Some things may be different for
        these sessions, such as the Actions menu which allows you to shut down,
        reboot, or configure GDM will not be shown.

      </span></h2><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM also supports the X Display Manager Protocol (XDMCP) for managing
        remote displays.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM listens to UDP port 177 and will respond to QUERY and
        BROADCAST_QUERY requests by sending a WILLING packet to the originator.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM can also be configured to honor INDIRECT queries and present a
        host chooser to the remote display. GDM will remember the user's
        choice and forward subsequent requests to the chosen manager.  GDM
        also supports an extension to the protocol which will make it forget
        the redirection once the user's connection succeeds.  This extension
        is only supported if both daemons are GDM.  It is transparent and
        will be ignored by XDM or other daemons that implement XDMCP.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        GDM only supports the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authentication system.
        Normally little is gained from the other schemes, and no effort has
        been made to implement them so far.  Because of this the cookies go
        over the wire as clear text, and thus you should be careful about what
        network you use this on.  That is, you should be careful about through
        where your XDMCP connection is going.  Note that obviously if snooping
        is possible, then the attacker could just snoop your password as you
        log in, so a better XDMCP authentication wouldn't help you much anyway.
        If snooping is possible and undesirable, then you had better use ssh
        for tunneling an X connection anyway rather then using GDM's XDMCP.
        You could think of XDMCP as a sort of graphical telnet, having the
        same security issues.

        On the upside, GDM's random number generation is very anal and GDM
        goes to extraordinary measures to truly get a 128 bit random number,
        using hardware random number generators if available, plus the current
        time (in microsecond precision), a 20 byte array of pseudorandom
        numbers, process pid's, plus other random information (possibly using
        <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/dev/audio</span> or <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/dev/mem</span> if
        hardware random generators are not available) to create a large buffer
        and then run MD5 digest on this.  Obviously, all this work is wasted if
        you send this cookie over an open network or store it on an NFS
        directory (see <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">UserAuthDir</span> configuration key).  So
        be careful about where you use remote X display.

        Since it is fairly easy to do denial of service attacks on the XDMCP

        Even though GDM tries to outsmart potential attackers, it is still
        advised that you block UDP port 177 on your firewall unless you really
        need it. GDM guards against DoS attacks, but the X protocol is still
        inherently insecure and should only be used in controlled environments.
        Also each remote connection takes up lots of resources, so it is much
        easier to to DoS an XDMCP server then say a webserver.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        In addition to UDP port 177, you should also block all the X server
        ports (TCP ports 6000 + display number) on the firewall as well.  Do
        note that various places in GDM will use display numbers 20 and higher
        (for example the on demand server stuff).  X is not a very safe
        protocol for leaving on the net, and XDMCP is even less safe.

        Even though your display is protected by cookies the XEvents and thus
        the keystrokes typed when entering passwords will still go over the
        wire in clear text. It is trivial to capture these.  You should also be
        aware that cookies, if placed on an NFS mounted directory, are prone to
        eavesdropping too.  In case of NFS home directories you should really
        use the <span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">UserAuthDir</span> and set it to some local

        XDMCP is primarily useful for running thin clients such as in terminal
        labs.  Those thin clients will only ever need the network to access
        the server, and so it seems like the best policy securitywise to have
        those thin clients on a separate network that cannot be accessed by
        the outside world, and can only connect to the server.  The only point
        from which you need to access outside is the server.

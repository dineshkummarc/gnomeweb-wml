Seahorse is the GNOME application for managing encryption keys and
passwords. It also integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for
encryption/decryption operations.

Important Notes:
=================

    * Seahorse now properly requires GTK+ 2.10

===============================

    * Fix a crash when deleting keys.
    * Require GTK+ 2.10 without which 1.0 didn't build
    * Use /tmp directory for agent sockets, so that seahorse
      works for people with home directories on NFS/AFS
    * Fixed importing of private keys from ssh-keygen
    * Fixed checks for memory locking
    * Epiphany plugin now builds with Epiphany 2.18 [Adam Schreiber]

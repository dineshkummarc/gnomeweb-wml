About Seahorse:
==================

This is a development release.

Seahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. It also
integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for
encryption/decryption operations.

Current work on seahorse is going into making encryption easier for end
users to use and (where needed) comprehend.

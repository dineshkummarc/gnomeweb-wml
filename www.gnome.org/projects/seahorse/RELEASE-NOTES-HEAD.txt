About Seahorse:
================

This is a development release.

Seahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. It also
integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for
encryption/decryption operations.

Current work on seahorse is going into making encryption easier for end
users to use and (where needed) comprehend.


Changes between 0.9.6 and 0.9.7:
================================

    * Use the new gnome-keyring functionality for accessing items 
      without secrets, thus avoiding a waterfall of prompts.
    * Cleanup the key loading code, fixes crashes caused by race 
      conditions.
    * Install helper programs to lib/seahorse instead of libexec
    * Stop using some LDAP deprecated functions.
    * UI/Usability Fixes.


Updated Translations:

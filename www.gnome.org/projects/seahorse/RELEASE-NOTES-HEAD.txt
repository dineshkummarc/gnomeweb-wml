About Seahorse:
================

This is a development release.

Seahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. It also
integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for
encryption/decryption operations.

Current work on seahorse is going into making encryption easier for end
users to use and (where needed) comprehend.


Important Note:
================

The GPG and SSH agent code now runs in the 'seahorse-agent' process. 
This is similar to how it used to work in Seahorse 0.8.x. 

If you've been running development versions (ie: 0.9.x) and have been 
starting 'seahorse-daemon' in your session, you'll need to change that 
to 'seahorse-agent' after installing this release.

Documentation on the nitty-gritty of properly starting seahorse-agent can be found here:

Changes between 0.9.8 and 0.9.9:

    * Documentation fixes by <milo_casagrande@yahoo.it>
    * Split agent and DBus daemon into separate processes
      for security and stability reasons.

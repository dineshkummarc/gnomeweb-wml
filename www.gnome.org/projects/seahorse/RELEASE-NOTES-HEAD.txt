Of build and bug fixes...

About Seahorse:
================

This is a development release.

Seahorse is a GNOME application for managing encryption keys. It also
integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for
encryption/decryption operations.

Current work on seahorse is going into making encryption easier for end
users to use and (where needed) comprehend.


Changes between 0.9.4 and 0.9.5:
=================================

    * Builds with GEdit 2.16 [Sebastian Dröge]
    * Export SSH public keys with proper new line at the end.
    * Fix build problem with libcryptui #defines [Adam Schreiber,
      Joseph Sacco]
    * Syncing now works again, and doesn't open an insane 
      amount of parallel connections when syncing lots of keys.
    * Removed some dubious async operation logic that was 
      causing crashes. 
    * Better progress calculations for operations.
    * Add version number to desktop files so bugzilla can 
      figure out the version.

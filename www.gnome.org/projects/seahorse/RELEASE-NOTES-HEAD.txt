Seahorse is the GNOME application for managing encryption keys and
passwords. It also integrates with nautilus, gedit and other places for
encryption/decryption operations.

This is an unstable release.


Changes between 2.21.4 and 2.21.90:
===================================

    * Remove options that screw with gpg.conf on seahorse-agent
      startup, since this was unsafe and naive.
    * Update libsoup optional dependency to depend on 2.4.x
      [Dan Winship]
    * Add icon for the gedit plugin [Adam Schreiber]
    * Don't add extra dot to encrypted or compressed files
      [Kip Warner]
    * Fix build problems with nautilus 2.21.x and later
      [Wouter Bolsterlee]
    * Install nautilus extension to correct directory
      [Brian Pepple]
    * Support better dropping of text keys onto main window
      [Christian Persch]

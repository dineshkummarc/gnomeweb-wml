One subdirectory per project, either an actual module in CVS or a
project that encompasses

Just something to keep in mind for each project's pages: Each project
should have a section for users and developers. Users would be people who
make use of the results of this project, and developers would be people
who help create the results. This means that for libraries etc., users are
application developers, and developers are the people who hack on
gnome-libs.

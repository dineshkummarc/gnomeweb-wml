Once installed, the app is started with:

<PRE>
  dia
</PRE>
<p>
This gives:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/mainwin.png" alt="mainwin.png"><p>
<p>
The first time up, you click File...Preferences and fill in personal
choices.  These are saved in your home dir as .dia/diarc.  For
example, I generally use the defaults except I make sure it is set to:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> User Interface...
<UL>
<LI> Compress...no (so I can easily manipulate the UML models later.  
    If I were worried about space, I'd use "yes")
</UL>
<LI> Grid lines...
<UL>
<LI> Visible...yes

<LI> Snap to...yes
</UL></UL><p>
After clicking OK on the preferences, you can make a diagram.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="L002">New diagram</A></H2>
<p>
Clicking File...New gives:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/newwin.png" alt="newwin.png"><p>
Right-clicking in that window gives a diagram-specific menu.  From that select File...page setup:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/newpage.png" alt="newpage.png"><p>
Typically:
<UL>
<LI> Paper size: Use Letter for US printers.

<LI> Orientation:  Use portrait for most web pages, 
and landscape for viewfoils

<LI> Margins:  Leave as is.  They resize for the paper size.

<LI> Scaling: Leave as Scale...100.  However, we'll come back to this later.
</UL><p>
After clicking OK, the page setup goes away and you are ready to
populate the diagram.
<p>

<H2><A NAME="L003">Draw an Organization Chart</A></H2>
<p>
An organization chart requires several boxes with text, some piped
solid lines, and a few dashed lines.  This can be done with the
basic tools.  So how do we use the basic tools?
<p>
Notice the mainwindow's layout:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/layout.png" alt="layout.png"><p>
If you hold the mouse over an icon, a tooltip will appear.  If you
click an icon, the tool is activated and any clicks in the diagram
will provide a copy of that tool. After clicking and placing one or
more copies of a shape, click the pointer tool (top left arrow icon)
before attempting to move things around.  (Otherwise you will get lots
of unexpected shapes.)
<p>
The easiest way to work is to:
<p>
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI> Select a shape

<LI> Click approximately the right number of them onto your diagram.

<LI> Label them (most shapes accept text labels).

<LI> Move the shapes into place.

<LI> Connect them with lines.  
Make sure the lines actually link to the shape handles.

<LI> Label the lines as needed.

<LI> Drag shapes and lines around as needed.  
Add connection points as needed to make tidy lines.

<LI> Add/modify more shapes and lines as needed.
</OL><p>
For an org chart, we'll start with:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/org1.png" alt="org1.png"><p>
That looks terrible.  The text doesn't line up with the boxes, and the
font is tacky.  How can we fix it?
<p>

<H2><A NAME="L004">Boxes and text</A></H2>
<p>
We could use a box which knows about text, and resizes around
text.  The boxes in the Flowchart library (e.g., the square) can do
this.  We could even make our own shape which knows about text.
<p>
But let's do it the hard way for now, with the basic box.
<p>
First, get the font right.  Select a text item.  Right-click to get
the menu, then Dialogs...Properties.  Select Helvetica.  Leave the
size as is -- we can scale later.  Do this for each text item.
<p>
Next, carefully center the text in the box.  Drag the box bigger if
needed.  Since the default is snap-to-grid, it will be difficult to
align the text.  So let's turn off snap-to-grid for a moment: With
the pointer tool, click somewhere in the diagram (but not on a
specific item), and type "g".  Drag the text as needed, then type "g"
again to toggle back to snap-to-grid.
<p>
Ok, the text is the right font and is aligned nicely.  Let's lock
those box-and-text combinations together.  Use the pointer to drag a
selection box (dashed lines) around a box-and-text combo.  Type
"Ctl-G" to make them a group.  Do this for each of the boxes.  
<p>
If you need to un-group a combo (e.g., to edit the text or realign),
type "Ctl-U".  For example, we notice misspellings, so we ungroup to
fix those and then regroup.
<p>
We now have:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/org2.png" alt="org2.png"><p>

<H2><A NAME="L005">Lines</A></H2>
<p>
Now we can draw some lines.  We'll use the piped lines (90 degree
turns).  We draw them approximately from one item to the next, and
then use the pointer to drag the ends directly to the handles at each
end.  The line end turns red when it locks in to a handle.
<p>
We want to make the lines more interesting.  
<p>
In general, lines are controlled from the main window in several ways:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI> Line color, via the foreground/background icon.

<LI> Line width, via the vertical lines of varying width

<LI> Line style (e.g., dotted, dashed), via the middle of the bottom row.

<LI> Line end arrows, via the left and right ends of the bottom row.
</OL><p>
All of these apply to future lines.  You can also modify an
already-drawn line.  Select it using the pointer.  Right-click to get
the diagram menu.  Select Dialogs...properties.  This brings up a
dialog for changing any of the line's properties.
<p>
Thus, to fix our current lines: For each line, select the line,
right-click to get the menu, select Dialogs...Properties, and change
the line width from 0.1 to 0.2.  Change the System
Architect-to-Project Manager line to dotted line.  But the wide dots
look odd, so we change to dashed lines.  The dashes are too long, so
we make the dash interval 0.5.  The net effect is:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/org3.png" alt="org3.png"><p>
Let's say the Systems Architect actually reports to the CIO (via a
long chain of middle managers of course).  We want to note that, but
not over emphasize it.  So we draw it in a thin line:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/org4.png" alt="org4.png"><p>
Ugh.  We want that line to go around the outside.  But there aren't
enough middle bending points in the line to do it.  So we select the
line and the middle-click, to get the add-segment dialog.  After
adding a segment or two, we can drag the line to make a nice
connection:
<p>
<IMG SRC="../basics/org5.png" alt="org5.png"><p>

<H2><A NAME="L006">Saving</A></H2>
<p>
Ok, the diagram looks pretty good.  Time to save it.  First, we want
to save the intellectual content, so we can later modify it.  Second,
we want to export it as a specific graphic format.
<p>
To save it, right-click for the menu, then File...Save.  Insert the
name, e.g., <TT>org.dia</TT>, and click OK.  If you are saving a whole
series of variants on the same file and need to save each to a
separate file, use File...Save As.  The file is saved in an XML format
which is mostly Scalable Vector graphics (SVG).  NOTE: Since we set
Compress to No in the user preferences, we can examine the file in a
text editor.  Go take a look.
<p>
To export a usable image, select File...Export, and then enter the
name with an appropriate extension, e.g., <TT>org.png</TT>.  Look at the
extensions list for candidates.  If you don't have a preference, we
suggest png (Portable Network Graphics).
<p>
A simple export may make a rather large image.  If you look closely at
the diagram window, you can see blue lines representing printable
pages.  Your diagram probably extends over several pages.  So if you
print out the diagram to a physical printer, you will need to tape the
pieces together.  This is not much of a concern for HTML, where the
browser can pan back and forth over a large image.  However, even for
HTML a large image can be awkward.
<p>
So here is the recommendation:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Build the diagram to any convenient size

<LI> Save it as is

<LI> Export it as is (full sized), for use in HTML links

<LI> Export another copy for directly embedding in an HTML page.
<p>
Do this via File...Page setup...Scaling...Fit 1 by 1.  This will show
the scaling needed to fit the whole diagram on one page.  But even
that may be too large, so you can switch back to Scaling...Scale, and
tweak the numbers until a convenient size is found for your HTML
context.

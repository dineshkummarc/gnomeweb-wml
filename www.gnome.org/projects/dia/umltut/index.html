    <h1>A UML tutorial</h1>

<P>I couldn't find a tutorial on the web on how to use UML in an actual
design. So I will share with you my bad grammar along with my
experience on my first UML design.</P>

<P>You can probably use a graphic tool to create UML designs. However
I'd recommand a tool created with UML in mind. It will save you a lot
of grief. I'm using a freeware tool named <A
HREF="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html">dia</A>. I'm not
using the latest version, but the 0.2 version seems to work ok, except
for the EPS output which I don't particularly like.</p>

<H2>The basics</H2>

<P>A class diagram allows you to document how the class relates to
other classes. The class diagram doesn't fix the actual
implementation. The actual code might not be a direct translation of
the diagram. However the functionnality of the code will remain the
same. In the following figure you can observe the following:
    <UL>
      <LI> <code>Class A</code> is a class which has some attributes (<code>variable</code>) and functions (<code>function</code>).
      <LI> <code>Class A</code> is the parent class of <code>Sub-Class</code>
      <LI> <code>Class A</code> is associated with <code>Class B</code>. In this case only 1 <code>Class B</code> is associated with possibly multple versions of <code>Class A</code>. The association is named <code>something</code>. Depending on the type of UML diagrams you are using, <code>something</code> can be implemented using a variable or by something else.
      <LI> <code>Class T</code> is a template class. In C++ it would be defined by something like <code>template <class T> Class_T { ... } </code>
      <LI> <code>Class B</code> is an instance of <code>Class T</code> where the parameter <code>T</code> is binded to <code>int</code>.
      <LI> <code>General</code> is a class that can add attributes (or function) to the association between <code>Class A</code> and <code>Class B</code>. In the present case, it adds the variable <code>period</code>. 
    </UL>
</P>

<P>The above diagram shows the logical relationship between the
components. It doesn't mean that a C++ class would be implemented
using all the 5 classes represented here. Short cuts can be
taken. However, the logical structure <em>must</em> remain the
same. For example, you can move <code>period</code> outside of the
<code>General</code> class and inside the <code>Sub-Class</code>. But
the logic of the association remains the same.</p>

<H2>The problem</H2>

<P>I'm working on the <A HREF="http://www.altima.org">Altima</A> project and
for it I want to create an isometric editor that can create worlds. It
was decided that everything on the Altima world would be an
entity. Using polymorphism, behavior can be added to the basic entity
model. My problem is to define an entity that is usable by the server
and the iso client.</P>

<P>The simplified requirements are:
<UL>
<LI> An entity has a unique id.
<LI> An entity has a bounding volume.
<LI> An entity has a graphic associated with it.
<LI> An entity has some general information associated with it.
<LI> A container contains multiple entities. A room would contain a bed, a table, a chair, a dresser, a chest, a lamp, etc. 
<LI> An entity (such as a player) can move from container to container.
</UL>
</P>

<h2>The UML designs</H2>

<P>To solve the above problem I started to design using UML. The first and second try introduce new UML particularities and the latest one tries to split and simplify the diagrams.</p>

<OL>
<LI> <A HREF="draft.shtml">The draft design</A>: based on the C++ code that was there at the time.
<LI> <A HREF="second.shtml">The second design</A>: a design that addresses the shortcomings of the first draft.
<LI> <A HREF="third.shtml">The third design</A>: adds functionnality and tries to simplify the entity diagram.
</OL>

  <links:link name="AutoDia" url="http://droogs.org/autodia/">
    AutoDia is a modular application that parses source code or data (if a
    handler is available) and produces an XML document in Dia format.
    Handlers for Perl, C++, Java and PHP are available.
    (This used to be called AutoDIAL.)

  <links:link name="Diazy" url="http://diazy.sourceforge.net/">
    Diazy is an open source software package that is modeled after portions
    of the proprietary system Rational Rose. Diazy's two main objectives
    are to generate a source code framework from a UML diagram that was
    created in the popular open source-diagramming tool Dia. It will also
    generate a Dia UML class relationship diagram form any object oriented
    code source.

  <links:link name="pstoshape.pl" url="http://public.logica.com/~redferni/dia/">
    A perl script that attempts to extract connected shapes from PostScript
    files.  In some cases, this makes it very easy to generate shapes.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="EMF Decoder" url="http://public.logica.com/~redferni/emf/">
     A Perl script that attempts to decode Visio documents (even inside
     Word documents) by looking at the EMF (Enhanced MetaFile) part.
     Unfortunately, Visio 2002 only uses bitmaps for EMF, but older files
     can be converted with some restrictions.  
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="HappyDoc" url="http://happydoc.sourceforge.net">
     HappyDoc generates documentation for Python programs, and can output
     Dia diagrams.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="Synopsis" url="http://synopsis.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html">
     Synposis is a documentation extraction tool.  It can output Dia
     diagrams among other things.  It doesn't try to do layout.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="ArgoUML2Dia" url="http://jerome.abela.free.fr/dia.html">
     ArgoUML2Dia converts from the ArgoUML format to Dia, though not all
     object types are supported yet.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="SchemaMania.org" url="http://www.schemamania.org">
    SchemaMania.org aims to be a repository for database design schemas.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="PostgreSQL AutoDoc" url="http://www.rbt.ca/autodoc/">
    A perl script which takes the database structure and exports an XML
    file which Dia can use, together with various documentation formats.
    This used to be called Postgres_to_Dia.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="Agata" url="http://agata.codigolivre.org.br/">
     Agata Report is a Report Generator, written in PHP-GTK.
     Allows you to edit and get SQL results from several Databases as
     Text or PostScript Files.  It can generate Dia diagrams with all the
     tables you are working on.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="Medoosa" url="http://medoosa.sourceforge.net/">
    Medoosa is a documentation tool for C++ that can produce UML class
   diagrams including generalizations and associations. Corrections can
   be made interactively in a diagram editor (Dia) and are fed back into
   the source as Javadoc-style comments.
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="cpp2dia" url="http://cpp2dia.sourceforge.net/">
    "cpp->dia" aka "cpp2dia" has been developed to create UML diagrams for
  Dia from an existing C++ source.  "cpp->dia" is a small console based
  Tcl script, that should not be too intractable. 
  The main focus for "cpp->dia" is at creating nice-looking UML diagrams, and
  not writing an high-end parser for C++ code. Therefore "cpp->dia" uses
  "ctags" to do the main work on parsing the C++ source. 
  To layout the UML graph in a not-random way, "cpp->dia" can utilize
  "Graphviz" from A T &amp; T Labs. 
  </links:link>
  <links:link name="OraSchemaDoc" url="http://oraschemadoc.sourceforge.net/">
  The goal of oraschemadoc is "JavaDoc" style detailed documentation for all
  objects in schemas covering Oracle specific features.  The result of
  executing oraschemadoc is a set of static html files.
  It is also possible to export the datamodel to Dia UML Diagram.

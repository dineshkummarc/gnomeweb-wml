  <p><b>2006-04-21:</b> New release 0.95 ready!</p>

Dia is now available in a new version 0.95.  This release
focuses on stability and ease of use, featuring a few major new features along
with a host of minor improvements and bugfixes that make it easier than ever
to create structured diagrams, models and illustrations for documentation,
articles, modeling, presentations and many other uses.  
<p>
Version 0.95 adds the following major features:

<ul>
 <li> New "mainpoint" system allows lines to be added by dragging
   from anywhere on one object to anywhere on another, and to always point
   towards the middle of an object even when that object is moved.

 <li> Python plug-ins added to create DOT output, generate Python bindings by
   'self reflection', and allow round-trip engineering plug-ins.

 <li> The grid can now automatically change size depending on your zoom level.

 <li> Text input now highlights the object that receives the input, and tabbing
   between text input areas on one or more objects is possible.

 <li> Several security problems fixed in XFig import and Python plug-in.

 <li> Many new shapes added, including automata, Gane & Sarson and AADL.

 <li> Several new UML objects added as well as some extensions to existing objects.

 <li> Full screen mode.

 <li> Improved SVG import, 

 <li> Plug-in loading and unloading doesn't require restart of Dia.

 <li> Many i18n problems have been fixed, particularly in export filters.

 <li> Many bugs have been fixed, too many to mention here.

 <li> Command line usage has improved to allow the selecting of individual layers
   and specific output filters.

 <li> Uses the new GTK+ File Dialog.

 <li> Experimental libgnomeprint and Cairo plug-ins.
</ul>

  <p><b>2006-02-12:</b> New release real soon now</p>
  After one and a half year of waiting 
  <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2006-February/msg00040.html">Dia 0.95-pre1</a> is 
  available. Please report any open issues in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=dia">bugzilla</a>
  so we can maybe sort them out before the final release.
  
  <p><b>2004-08-24:</b> version 0.94</p>

  This is partly a bugfix release for some compatibility problems with
  shapes, and partly includes some development done during the 0.93
  release process.  The most important improvements in this release
  are:

  <ul>
<li> Highlighting of objects when connecting to them makes it easier to
  connect.

<li> New shape sets include:
<ul>
  <li> RDP (Petri Networks shapes)

  <li> ChemEng (chemical engineering)
</ul>
<li> Hexagonal grid, for all you chemists out there.

<li> Allow selection between layers, selectable in layers dialog.

<li> Disparate persistence systems replaced by one combined system using XML,
  leaves unknown preferences alone.

<li> Many smaller bug fixes, leaks closed and stuff.
</ul>

  <p><b>2004-05-04:</b>New release, version 0.93</p>

  The most important improvements in this release are:

  <ul><li>the addition of font-config to the Win32 side, which unifies fonts and allow antialiased view and high-quality PNG output there.
    <li>Text rendering, having slowed down somewhat with Gtk 2.0, is now cached and thus significantly faster.
  </ul>

  Other improvements include:

  <ul>
  <li> Standard Ellipse now has connection point and handle in center, and
  is resized around the center.

<li> Arrow head size selection now keeps aspect ratio by default.

<li> Line style and arrow head selectors now visual instead of textual in
  properties dialogs.

<li> Several sets of shapes added, including isometric map, cybernetics, 

<li> Added navigation window in lower-right corner.

<li> UML objects can now have color.

<li> Dia can now convert objects without requiring X.  PNG size can be
  specified with --size.

<li> Menus have been overhauled, more shortcuts added.

<li> Preedit text input much improved.

<li> Numerous improvements in metapost and xfig filters.

<li> Default arrow size now 0.5 cm.

<li> Minimum diagram size is very small now.

<li> Improvements to the Python plug-in.

<li> Shapes now support images.

<li> Greeked text replacing very small font rendering.

<li> Added XSLT sheets:  Python, OWL, Mac, Component List

<li> Shapes can now have extra properties, shown only in the dialog.

<li> New arrows: Half-circle and Filled Dot And Triangle.
</ul>
...and an untold number of bug fixes, leak plugs, and minor improvements.  Enjoy!
  
  <p><b>2003-10-19:</b> New release, version 0.92</p>

  <p>This release contains a number of various fixes and improvements, in particular in the user interface. Most importantly, zig-zag lines can now be automatically laid out by Dia, solving the old problem of making them horizontal/vertical to match the objects.</p>

  <p>Additional improvements include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Parenting. Objects can now be set to be parents of others (so far, only the UML Large Package is set so by default). Objects created into these or explicitly added are moved with the parent and cannot be moved outside.</li>

    <li>Dynamic grid that changes with zoom scale.</li>

    <li>Grid now has thicker line every n lines (default 5). Stippled grid option removed.</li>

    <li>ESC and Enter now usable for exiting properties dialogs.</li>

    <li>Mouse wheel(s) can be used to scroll and zoom.</li>

    <li>When using menu bar, middle button pans the diagram.</li>

    <li>Documents now remember if they were compressed or not when loaded.</li>

    <li>Documents are always prettyprinted, to allow version control.</li>

    <li>More diagram properties can be set for existing diagrams, and are loaded and saved.</li>

    <li>UML Component features: Event sources and sinks.</li>

    <li>Improved undo of grouping and ungrouping.</li>

    <li>Ensure loading of fonts and (semi-)correct DPI setting for Pango.</li>

    <li>Use $PRINTER correctly in print dialog.</li>

    <li>Use Win32 PS font EPS rendering on Unix as well, to allow the various manipulation tools to work.</li>

    <li>Libart rendering is back on win32.</li>

    <li>Allow choosing the export format explicitly when multiple possibilities exist.</li>

    <li>Updates of the Python plugin:

      <ul>
        <li>groups, rgb, and images can be manipulated</li>

        <li>better svg parsing</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>XFig arrow head import and export, correct dash lengths, comment handling</li>

    <li>Now remembers the last selected sheet.</li>

    <li>Better Metapost output, with images.</li>

    <li>Gnome and Gnome HIG conformance better.</li>

    <li>Better text alignment in flowchart objects.</li>

    <li>Window positions are now remembered from run to run.</li>

    <li>Standardization of error messages and shape descriptions.</li>

    <li>Better SVG export.</li>

    <li>Better arrow head calculations.</li>

    <li>More tooltips.</li>

    <li>Snap to grid icon in status bar.</li>

    <li>Opens a new diagram if Dia is started with a non-existing file as argument.</li>

    <li>Updated man page.</li>

    <li>Change to CHM manual format for Windows.</li>

    <li>A number of various bugs fixed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Warning</em> This release introduces some binary compatibility changes that anyone with their own plugins should take note of. Old compiled plugins will no longer work. There's an interface change for objects, though most objects will just need to change their prototypes.</p>

  <p><b>2003-09-02:</b> Prerelease of version 0.92</p>

  <p>The first prerelease of 0.92 is out, with autorouting of zig-zag lines and object parenting as the major new things.</p>

  <p><b>2003-03-14:</b> New release, version 0.91</p>

  <p>Todays release of Dia 0.91 ends 9 months of work on converting Dia to Gtk 2.0. This change means that support for non-Latin scripts are no longer crude hacks, and the font handling is more consistent, both within diagrams and between the screen and printing.</p>

  <p>In addition to the improvements associated with Gtk 2.0, a number of other improvements have been made along the way:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The renderers are now proper GObjects and inherit default drawing routines when possible. Beside more maintainable source code this gives export fiters the ability to write e.g. bezier approximations without having to write a single line of code in the export filter.</li>

    <li>Most Dia objects now support setting some defaults. Simply double-click on the respective object button to change them.</li>

    <li>The Python plug-in is updated and tested. Some working examples are included. Note that the Python plug-in is not compiled in by default.</li>

    <li>Some effort has been made to follow the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines (HIG), which should make it more consistent with the Gnome desktop.</li>

    <li>Cursors styles have been changed to give better feedback.</li>

    <li>Dia now autosaves changed diagrams.</li>

    <li>Comments have been added to UML classes.</li>

    <li>Dynamic refresh of objects has been added, allowing animated objects (see the clock object in the Misc sheet).</li>

    <li>The object defaults system has been much improved, and most objects now allow defaults to be set by double-clicking the icons. Defaults changes are persistent.</li>

    <li>A number of bugs have been found and corrected, including a long-standing anti-aliasing bug.</li>

    <li>A number of new shapes have been added, including over 200 Cisco shapes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Warning:</em> Since the font handling is changed, some elements in old diagrams may change size. Since the font size was somewhat arbitrary in older versions of Dia, there is little we can do to fix this. <em>Note:</em> The Windows version of Dia doesn't support Freetype font rendering, due to font-config problems. This means that anti-aliasing (including high-quality PNG output) and EPS output cannot handle text at all under Windows.</p>

  <p><b>2003-01-31:</b> Prerelease of version 0.91</p>

  <p>Today the first prerelease of version 0.91 was put on the gnome ftp servers. Please take it and bang on it. If no serious bugs are found within 10 days, it shall become 0.91. The main new features in this release are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Switch to Gtk-2.0. This took most of our time to get right, mostly because of font issues. Fonts on Unix are now handled entirely by FreeType2, ensuring WYSIWYG. Unfortunately, the Windows version of Pango doesn't allow getting outlines or bitmaps, so export to PNG and EPS, as well as antialiased text, is not working yet. Sorry.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>2002-06-01:</b> New release, version 0.90</p>

  <p>After over a year of hacking, a new release of Dia is now ready. This version includes more changes than you can shake an inheritance arrow at. Most prominently:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Full UTF-8 support internally.</li>

    <li>Diagram tree dialog.</li>

    <li>Sheets editor means you don't have to edit text files at all to make new shapes.</li>

    <li>Even more shapes and export filters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is also the first release with Cyrille Chepelov &amp; Lars Clausen as joint maintainers. We thank James Henstridge for taking his turn at the wheel. An installer for the Windows port can be found <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dia-installer/dia-0.90-1-setup.exe" target="_top">here</a>.<br />
  <br />
  The next release is intended to move us to GTK2.0.</p>

  <p><b>2001-05-21:</b> dia-list moved to gnome.org</p>

  <p>The dia mailing list has been moved to gnome.org. All subscribers to the previous list has been moved over to the new one. You can subscribe to the new list <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/dia-list" target="_top">here</a>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Input method support should work correctly now.</li>

    <li>SVG shape files now use namespace from final W3C recommendation. Addon shapes will have to be modified to use the http://www.w3.org/2000/SVG namespace for SVG. SVG export filter also uses correct doctype.</li>

    <li>menus should now work in both gtk+ and gnome builds and have no i18n related problems. Don't look in app/menus.c.</li>

    <li>pstricks renderer output should now work fine without modification now.</li>

    <li>gdk-pixbuf is now a requirement for building dia. It no longer falls back to imlib if it can't find gdk-pixbuf.</li>

    <li>handle "file not found" errors better in the image object type.</li>

    <li>Dia now has documentation thanks to the GDP. The help menu now has more than just an about menu item.</li>

    <li>Antialiased drawing mode probably won't crash dia anymore</li>

    <li>Dia has a splash screen now (which can be turned off with the --nosplash option).</li>

    <li>Updated bonobo support (when --enable-bonobo is used)</li>

    <li>added expose event compression for the dia canvas, which makes dia more usable over remote X connections.</li>

    <li>Many objects updated to use properties interface.</li>

    <li>experimental unicode print support (--enable-unicode)</li>

    <li>updates to the python plugin and now distribute it with dia (--with-python)</li>

    <li>many new shapes and export filter plugins.</li>

    <li>other bug fixes.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Dia is now an official GNU program.</li>

    <li>Bug fixes to polygon, so that undo/redo of adding a point works correctly, and added extra connection points to shape. (james)</li>

    <li>added unfinished DXF import filter (Steffen).</li>

    <li>XIM support added.</li>

    <li>added beziergon object. (james)</li>

    <li>The right click menu now behaves correctly when torn off. Actions will be performed on the last active display, which is defined as the last display to receive mouse clicks or keyboard input. (james)</li>

    <li>added little button to top left hand corner of display for bringing up the right click menu, as in gimp-1.1. (james)</li>

    <li>Layers dialog changes selected diagram when the active display changes. (james)</li>

    <li>fixed bug in custom shape code affecting drawing of ellipses/circles.</li>

    <li>WPG and HPGL export filters added (Hans)</li>

    <li>Updated gnome-print code so that it respects the settings in the page setup dialog. The gnome-print code is still not as good as the straight postscript code.</li>

    <li>Added a diagram properties dialog where you can manipulate the grid settings (which are now saved with the diagram) and background colour.</li>

    <li>many other bug fixes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>2000-05-18:</b> New release, version 0.85 New in this release:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bug fix for bringing up properties window when a group of objects that don't implement the properties code are selected (james).</li>

    <li>New sheets: Pneumatic, Electric and Civil (from Cyrille and Steffen).</li>

    <li>New export filters: TeX PSTricks and DXF (from Jacek and Steffen respectively).</li>

    <li>dia will now use gdk-pixbuf in preference to imlib if it is found on the system when compiling.</li>

    <li>there is a simple (unfinished) bonobo component now. To build it, you must pass --enable-bonobo to configure (this will not affect whether the normal dia is built). (Alex)</li>

    <li>Bug fixes in FS objects by David Thompson.</li>

    <li>new plugin system, along with a plugin manager where you can prevent plugins from being loaded (james).</li>

    <li>Objects handled by the custom sheet code now have a better distance algorithm -- before it just used a bounding box (james).</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>2000-02-29:</b> New release, version 0.84. New in this release:</p>

  <ul>

    <li>Start of support for properties code. <b>THIS IS NOT FINISHED AND THE INTERFACES ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE NEXT RELEASE. DON'T WRITE NEW OBJECTS AGAINST THESE NEW INTERFACES UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THEM TO BREAK WITH THE NEXT RELEASE.</b> That said, this adds a number of nice features for users. You can now group a number of properties supporting objects (currently the `standard' objects, custom objects and the flowchart box), and change some of the properties as a group.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>98-12-07:</b> I've done some major updated to the CVS version of Dia.<br />
  Now the file format is XML, which means you have to install gnome-xml before Dia. I've found some bugs in gnome-xml which the author has fixed. Make sure you got at least version 1.19 of tree.c.</p>

  <p>I also updated all code to Gtk 1.1.5, in preparation for the soon upcoming Gtk+ 1.2 release.</p>

  <p>I've also created a mailinglist for Dia, where people can discuss the design, development and usage of Dia. I was starting to get mail from so many people it was hard to coordinate and cooperate.

<p><b>2003-10-19:</b> New release, version 0.92</p>
This release contains a number of various fixes and improvements, in
particular in the user interface.  Most importantly, zig-zag lines can now
be automatically laid out by Dia, solving the old problem of making them
horizontal/vertical to match the objects.
<p>
Additional improvements include:

<ul>
<li>Parenting.  Objects can now be set to be parents of others (so far, only
  the UML Large Package is set so by default).  Objects created into these
  or explicitly added are moved with the parent and cannot be moved
  outside.
<li>Dynamic grid that changes with zoom scale.
<li>Grid now has thicker line every n lines (default 5).  Stippled grid
  option removed.
<li>ESC and Enter now usable for exiting properties dialogs.
<li>Mouse wheel(s) can be used to scroll and zoom. 
<li>When using menu bar, middle button pans the diagram.
<li>Documents now remember if they were compressed or not when loaded.
<li>Documents are always prettyprinted, to allow CVS.
<li>More diagram properties can be set for existing diagrams, and are loaded
  and saved.
<li>UML Component features:  Event sources and sinks.
<li>Improved undo of grouping and ungrouping.
<li>Ensure loading of fonts and (semi-)correct DPI setting for Pango.
<li>Use $PRINTER correctly in print dialog.
<li>Use Win32 PS font EPS rendering on Unix as well, to allow the various
  manipulation tools to work.
<li>Libart rendering is back on win32.
<li>Allow choosing the export format explicitly when multiple possibilities
  exist. 
<li>Updates of the Python plugin:
<ul>
  <li> groups, rgb, and images can be manipulated
  <li> better svg parsing
</ul>
<li>XFig arrow head import and export, correct dash lengths, comment handling
<li>Now remembers the last selected sheet.
<li>Better Metapost output, with images.
<li>Gnome and Gnome HIG conformance better.
<li>Better text alignment in flowchart objects.
<li>Window positions are now remembered from run to run.
<li>Standardization of error messages and shape descriptions.
<li>Better SVG export.
<li>Better arrow head calculations.
<li>More tooltips.
<li>Snap to grid icon in status bar.
<li>Opens a new diagram if Dia is started with a non-existing file as argument.
<li>Updated man page.
<li>Change to CHM manual format for Windows.
<li>A number of various bugs fixed.
</ul>

<em>Warning</em> This release introduces some binary compatibility changes
that anyone with their own plugins should take note of.  Old compiled
plugins will no longer work.  There's an interface change for objects,
though most objects will just need to change their prototypes.

<p><b>2003-09-02:</b> Prerelease of version 0.92</p>

The first prerelease of 0.92 is out, with autorouting of zig-zag lines and
object parenting as the major new things.  

<p><b>2003-03-14:</b> New release, version 0.91</p>
Todays release of Dia 0.91 ends 9 months of work on converting Dia to Gtk
2.0.  This change means that support for non-Latin scripts are no longer
crude hacks, and the font handling is more consistent, both within diagrams
and between the screen and printing.
<p>
In addition to the improvements associated with Gtk 2.0, a number of
other improvements have been made along the way:

<ul>
<li>The renderers are now proper GObjects and inherit default drawing
routines when possible.  Beside more maintainable source code
  this gives export fiters the ability to write e.g. bezier
  approximations without having to write a single line of code
  in the export filter.
<li>Most Dia objects now support setting some defaults. Simply 
  double-click on the respective object button to change them.
<li>The Python plug-in is updated and tested.  Some working examples are
included.  Note that the Python plug-in is not compiled in by default.
<li>Some effort has been made to follow the Gnome Human Interface
Guidelines (HIG), which should make it more consistent with the Gnome
desktop.
<li>Cursors styles have been changed to give better feedback.
<li>Dia now autosaves changed diagrams.
<li>Comments have been added to UML classes.
<li>Dynamic refresh of objects has been added, allowing animated objects
(see the clock object in the Misc sheet).
<li>The object defaults system has been much improved, and most objects now
allow defaults to be set by double-clicking the icons.  Defaults changes
are persistent.
<li>A number of bugs have been found and corrected, including a
long-standing anti-aliasing bug.
<li>A number of new shapes have been added, including over 200 Cisco shapes.
</ul>

<em>Warning:</em>  Since the font handling is changed, some elements in old
diagrams may change size.  Since the font size was somewhat arbitrary in
older versions of Dia, there is little we can do to fix this.

<em>Note:</em> The Windows version of Dia doesn't support Freetype font
rendering, due to font-config problems.  This means that anti-aliasing
(including high-quality PNG output) and EPS output cannot handle text at
all under Windows.

<p><b>2003-01-31:</b> Prerelease of version 0.91</p>
Today the first prerelease of version 0.91 was put on the gnome ftp
servers.  Please take it and bang on it.  If no serious bugs are found
within 10 days, it shall become 0.91.

The main new features in this release are:
<ul>
<li>Switch to Gtk-2.0.  This took most of our time to get right, mostly
because of font issues.  Fonts on Unix are now handled entirely by
FreeType2, ensuring WYSIWYG.  Unfortunately, the Windows version of Pango
doesn't allow getting outlines or bitmaps, so export to PNG and EPS, as
well as antialiased text, is not working yet.  Sorry.
</ul>

<p><b>2002-06-01:</b> New release, version 0.90</p>

After over a year of hacking, a new release of Dia is now ready.  This
version includes more changes than you can shake an inheritance arrow at.
Most prominently:
<ul>
<li>Full UTF-8 support internally.
<li>Diagram tree dialog.
<li>Sheets editor means you don't have to edit text files at all to make
new shapes.
<li>Even more shapes and export filters.
</ul>

This is also the first release with Cyrille Chepelov & Lars Clausen as
joint maintainers.  We thank James Henstridge for taking his turn at the
wheel. 

An installer for the Windows port can be found <a

target="_top">here</a>.</p>

The next release is intended to move us to GTK2.0.

<p><b>2001-05-21:</b> dia-list moved to gnome.org</p>
<p>The dia mailing list has been moved to gnome.org. All subscribers to the previous list
has been moved over to the new one. You can subscribe to the new list <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/dia-list" target="_top">here</a>.
<p>

<p><b>2001-05-20:</b> New release, version 0.88.1  New in this release:</p>
 <ul>
  <li> Input method support should work correctly now.
  <li> SVG shape files now use namespace from final W3C recommendation.
  Addon shapes will have to be modified to use the
  http://www.w3.org/2000/SVG namespace for SVG.  SVG export filter
  also uses correct doctype.
  <li> menus should now work in both gtk+ and gnome builds and have no i18n
  related problems.  Don't look in app/menus.c.
  <li> pstricks renderer output should now work fine without modification now.
  <li> gdk-pixbuf is now a requirement for building dia.  It no longer
  falls back to imlib if it can't find gdk-pixbuf.
  <li> handle "file not found" errors better in the image object type.
  <li> Dia now has documentation thanks to the GDP.  The help menu now has
  more than just an about menu item.
  <li> Antialiased drawing mode probably won't crash dia anymore
  <li> Dia has a splash screen now (which can be turned off with the
  --nosplash option).
  <li> Updated bonobo support (when --enable-bonobo is used)
  <li> added expose event compression for the dia canvas, which makes dia
  more usable over remote X connections.
  <li> Many objects updated to use properties interface.
  <li> experimental unicode print support (--enable-unicode)
  <li> updates to the python plugin and now distribute it with dia (--with-python)
  <li> many new shapes and export filter plugins.
  <li> other bug fixes.
 </ul>
<p>An installer for the Windows port can be found <a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dia-installer/dia-0.88.2-setup.exe"
target="_top">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>2000-08-06:</b> New release, version 0.86  New in this release:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Dia is now an official GNU program.
  <li>Bug fixes to polygon, so that undo/redo of adding a point works correctly,
  and added extra connection points to shape. (james)
  <li>added unfinished DXF import filter (Steffen).
  <li>XIM support added.
  <li>added beziergon object. (james)
  <li>The right click menu now behaves correctly when torn off.  Actions will be
  performed on the last active display, which is defined as the last display
  to receive mouse clicks or keyboard input. (james)
  <li>added little button to top left hand corner of display for bringing up
  the right click menu, as in gimp-1.1. (james)
  <li>Layers dialog changes selected diagram when the active display changes.
  (james)
  <li>fixed bug in custom shape code affecting drawing of ellipses/circles.
  <li>WPG and HPGL export filters added (Hans)
  <li>Updated gnome-print code so that it respects the settings in the page
  setup dialog.  The gnome-print code is still not as good as the straight
  postscript code.
  <li>Added a diagram properties dialog where you can manipulate the grid
  settings (which are now saved with the diagram) and background colour.
  <li>many other bug fixes.
 </ul>

<p><b>2000-05-18:</b> New release, version 0.85  New in this release:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Bug fix for bringing up properties window when a group of objects that
  don't implement the properties code are selected (james).
  <li>New sheets: Pneumatic, Electric and Civil (from Cyrille and Steffen).
  <li>New export filters: TeX PSTricks and DXF (from Jacek and Steffen
  respectively).
  <li>New polygon object (Lars).
  <li>You can now select between symmetric, smooth and cusp as the vertex style
  for the segments in a bezier line object (Lars, james).
  <li>Some fixups to make sure preferences and save files are written with
  LC_NUMERIC set to C (james).
  <li>dia will now use gdk-pixbuf in preference to imlib if it is found on the
  system when compiling.
  <li>there is a simple (unfinished) bonobo component now.  To build it, you
  must pass --enable-bonobo to configure (this will not affect whether the
  normal dia is built).  (Alex)
  <li>Bug fixes in FS objects by David Thompson.
  <li>new plugin system, along with a plugin manager where you can prevent
  plugins from being loaded (james).
  <li>Objects handled by the custom sheet code now have a better distance
  algorithm -- before it just used a bounding box (james).
  <li>New select submenu in the right click menu that makes it easier to select
  groups of objects (Lars).
 </ul>

<p><b>2000-02-29:</b> New release, version 0.84.  New in this release:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Bug fixes in sheet loading and object initialisation code -- this fixes
  some of the seg faults in 0.83.
  <li>Lots of new shapes (GRAFCET, SADT, chronogram and Contact from Cyrille)
  <li>Fixed up fit to page so that it adjusts the scaling as you change the
  size of the diagram.  Also allow fit to multiple pages.
  <li>Show page breaks on diagram (this can be disabled in the preferences).
  <li>CGM export filter fixes (most of this work was by Henk Jan Priester).
  <li>SVG export filter fixes -- now it handles images as well.
  <li>EPS filter now uses scaling factor set in page setup dialog.  This was
  added because some apps do not allow scaling of an EPS file after importing
  it.
  <li>High quality anti aliased libart based renderer (Alex).
  <li>PNG export filter (requires libpng and libart).
  <li>toolbox is resizable kind of like the gimp-1.1 toolbox.
  <li>Win32 port by Hans Breuer -- see
  <a href="http://hans.breuer.org/dia/" target="_top">http://hans.breuer.org/dia/</a>
  <li>Start of support for properties code.  <b>THIS IS NOT FINISHED AND THE
  INTERFACES ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE NEXT RELEASE.  DON'T WRITE NEW
  OBJECTS AGAINST THESE NEW INTERFACES UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THEM TO
  BREAK WITH THE NEXT RELEASE.</b>  That said, this adds a number of nice
  features for users.  You can now group a number of properties supporting
  objects (currently the `standard' objects, custom objects and the
  flowchart box), and change some of the properties as a group.
 </ul>

<p><b>99-12-25:</b> New release, version 0.83.  New in this release:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Copying/pasting of bezier and image objects should work correctly.
  <li>New export filter interface, which allows export filters to be
  loaded from plugins rather than being integrated into the application.
  <li>New CGM export plugin.  It currently doesn't handle beziers yet, but
  it does handle all other aspects of rendering.
  <li>Fixed rendering of logo in about dialog.
  <li>Don't reencode the symbol font in latin1, as this stops it working.
  <li>Renamed the --export-to-ps option to --export (the short form is still
  -e).  It now works out which filter to use based on the file extension.
  <li>Portability fixes.
 </ul>

<p><b>99-12-14:</b> New release, version 0.82.  New in this release:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Dia has a new maintainer now.
   <li>It is now possible to rearange the icons in the toolbox by editing
   simple XML files.  You can also create new sheets composed of your
   favourite shapes.  This feature is the work of Cyrille Chepelov
   <li>New bezierline object.  This object is by Lars Clausen and me (James).
   <li>Better integration with the gnome file manager -- dia files now have an
   icon, and you can double click on a file to launch dia.
   <li>more memory leak fixes based on purify runs by Bruce Mitchener.
   <li>By holding down shift when using the zoom tool, you can zoom out.  This
   feature was from Patrick Reynolds.
   <li>By holding shift when using the move tool, it changes its behaviour to
   the `grab' type scrolling as seen in acrobat, eog and other programs.
   <li>More circuit shapes from Andreas Scherf.
   <li>Other bug fixes I haven't mentioned above (see ChangeLog for details).

  before Dia. I've found some bugs in gnome-xml which the author has fixed.
  Make sure you got at least version 1.19 of tree.c.</p>
<p>I also updated all code to Gtk 1.1.5, in preparation for the soon upcoming
  Gtk+ 1.2 release.</p>
<p>I've also created a mailinglist for Dia, where people can discuss the
  design, development and usage of Dia. I was starting to get mail from so
  many people it was hard to coordinate and cooperate. To subscribe, just
  send a mail to <a href="mailto:dia-list-request@lysator.liu.se">
  dia-list-request@lysator.liu.se</a> with the word subscribe in the subject.
  For more info about the mailinglist see the developers page.</p>

<p><b>98-11-15:</b> Update to the Dia homepage, design mostly done by
  Toussaint frédéric (ftoussin@club-internet.fr). <br>
  <b>Note:</b> I have worked on Dia since the last news-entry, but i don't
  update this page often. If you're interested in the development of Dia,
  look at the ChangeLog in the Gnome CVS tree.</p>

<p><b>98-09-01:</b> Dia is in the Gnome CVS tree now.</p>

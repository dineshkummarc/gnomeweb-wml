  <p>Welcome to Dia's homepage. Dia is a gtk+ based diagram creation program released under the GPL license.</p>

  <p>Dia is designed to be much like the commercial Windows program 'Visio'. It can be used to draw many different kinds of diagrams. It currently has special objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams, flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple circuits. It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple XML files, using a subset of SVG to draw the shape.</p>

  <p>It can load and save diagrams to a custom XML format (gzipped by default, to save space), can export diagrams to EPS or SVG formats and can print diagrams (including ones that span multiple pages).</p>

  <p>I feel Dia is in a state where it can be actively used. Many features are implemented and the code is quite solid and mature. Please try it out and tell me what you think of it. If you find any bugs, please <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=dia" target="_top">report them</a> with <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org" target="_top">Gnome Bugzilla</a>. Check out the code too, <b>you might even want to contribute...</b></p>

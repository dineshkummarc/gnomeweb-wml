<p>Welcome to Dia's homepage. Dia is a gtk+ based diagram creation program
released under the GPL license.</p>

<p>Dia is designed to be much like the commercial Windows program 'Visio'.
It can be used to draw many different kinds of diagrams.  It currently has
special objects to help draw entity relationship diagrams, UML diagrams,
flowcharts, network diagrams, and simple circuits.  It is also possible to
add support for new shapes by writing simple XML files, using a subset of
SVG to draw the shape.</p>

<p>It can load and save diagrams to a custom XML format (gzipped by default,
to save space), can export diagrams to EPS or SVG formats and can print
diagrams (including ones that span multiple pages).</p>

<p>I feel Dia is in a state where it can be actively used. Many features
are implemented and the code is quite solid and mature.  Please try it out
and tell me what you think of it.  If you find any bugs, please <a
href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=dia" target="_top">report them</a>
with <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org"  target="_top">Gnome Bugzilla</a>.  Check out the
code too, <b>you might even want to contribute...</b></p>

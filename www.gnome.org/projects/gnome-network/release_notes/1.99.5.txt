client network-oriented tools, which currently contains a network
information tool, a remote shell and desktop clients, a personal web
server and a desktop sharing tool.

Changes since 1.99.4
--------------------

  General:
                                                                                
    - Redid tarball with jhbuild's libtool, since Debian sid's was
      creating an invalid one (Rodrigo Moya)
    - Use libvncserver-config to detect libvncserver CFLAGS and
      LIBS (Marcin Krzynanowski)

Tarballs can be downloaded from 
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-network/1.99/
Apart from the tarball in this release, you will need:
* a decent GNOME 2.x system and libraries
* libcherokee
(http://www.alobbs.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=cherokee&file=index)
for the Personal Web Server
* libvncserver (http://libvncserver.sf.net) for the desktop sharing tool

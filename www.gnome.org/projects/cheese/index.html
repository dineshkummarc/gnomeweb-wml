        Dear Cheese user!<br/>
        We are constantly trying to support more and more webcams. Therefore we
        need YOUR help! Yeah, exactly, we mean YOU! Got 5 minutes spare time?
        Please <a href="detect.py">download this small python script</a>, start
        HAL, attach your webcam and run it. The output, which is a
        <a href="http://people.freedesktop.org/~david/hal-spec/hal-spec.html#spec-device-info">HAL-fdi</a>
        file, should be send to
        <a href="mailto:patrys@pld-linux.org?subject=detect.py output for Cheese">Patryk Zawadzki</a>,
        who then will enhance the webcam-handling in Cheese by using HAL.<br/>
        Thanks a lot!

            <h2>What is Cheese?</h2>

            <p>
            Cheese is a GNOME application designed to take photos and videos of you
            and your friends with your webcam, add special effects to them and share
            them with your friends and family.
            It was written as part of Google's 2007 Summer of Code lead by
            <a href="http://home.cs.tum.edu/~siegel">daniel g. siegel</a> and
            mentored by <a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net">Raphaël
              Slinckx</a>, and has most
            of the classical photo booth features after a bare couple of months of
            development. Under the hood, Cheese uses GStreamer to apply fancy
            effects to photos and videos.  After a success of the Summer
            of Code, the development continued and we still are looking for
            people with nice ideas and patches ;)
            </p>

            <h2>Effects</h2>
            <div class="iconr">
            <img src="data/images/preferences-desktop-wallpaper.png" alt="icon" />
            </div>
            <p>
            Just bought a webcam? That's boring, it's much more fun morphing yourself
            into Hulk or a nice pink alien, or even pile up effects in order to
            obtain the most amazing results! Right now, you can for instance apply the
            following effects to photos and videos:
            </p>

            <div style="width: 48%; float: left;">
            <ul>
              <li>Mauve</li>
              <li>Noir/Blanc</li>
              <li>Saturation</li>
              <li>Hulk</li>
              <li>Shagadelic</li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div style="width: 48%; float: right;">
            <ul>
              <li>Vertical Flip</li>
              <li>Horizontal Flip</li>
              <li>Vertigo</li>
              <li>Edge</li>
              <li>Dice</li>
              <li>Warp</li>
            </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Scene 42, action!</h2>
            <div class="iconl">
            <img src="data/images/video-x-generic.png" alt="icon" />
            </div>
            <p>
            In addition to photos, Cheese allows you to record videos. Even
            there you can record them with effects. So Mr.
            Kubrick, go ahead and present us your new Hollywood-movie!
            </p>


            <h2>Share</h2>
            <div class="iconr">
            <img src="data/images/system-users.png" alt="icon" />
            </div>
            <p>
            Finished taking pictures and movies? Or doesn't your makeup look
            good? Then go ahead and share your files to your friends and
            family! It's already possible to export
            photos to F-Spot and upload them to Flickr, mail them or use them
            as your account photo in GNOME. Of course you can save it anywhere
            on your disk. Future releases will provide bindings to 
            <a href="http://www.conduit-project.org">Conduit</a>, which will
            allow you to share your photos and videos to many more places, e.g.
            setting the Facebook account photo or putting your Hulk-like photo
            on your iPod!
            </p>

          </div>

          <div id="bottomLeftRight">

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <div class="iconl">
            <img src="data/images/dialog-information.png" alt="icon" />
            </div>
            <p>
            The project isn't stopping here. We are already
            looking forward, and an integration with Conduit already in the
            works will permit exchanging online photos and videos as well as
            deep integration with the desktop. 
            The software will also use OpenGL to speed-up image
            and video processing, enabling us to add real-time effects as well as
            eye-candy. We are already considering features such as live
            incrustation of props and backgrounds, motion tracking, automatic
            hackergotchi creation, raffle mode and much more..
            If you want to know more, have a look at our 
            <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Cheese/Ideas">crazy ideas</a>
            and a very ambitious

            Do you want a little discussion about Cheese? Do you want to start
            flames, because there is no effect which makes you look like Arnold
            Schwarzenegger? Do you want to complain, because there is no
            filter, which simulates an ice-cream? Join our

          We are working very hard on the next Cheese version. Cheese was quite
          entirely rewritten and we have a tremendous amount of new
          features.<br />
          <ul>
            <li>
            If you want to help us to test and improve Cheese before it gets
            stable, please do so and install therefore GStreamer from CVS and
            Cheese from SVN.
            </li>
            <li>
            If you have a nice idea, of which you think it should be included
            in the next version, please tell us your idea on the
            <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/cheese-list">cheese mailing list</a>

      I'm getting a really slow response with the video, the video is sluggish
      and everything looks quite slow, like as the video lags, what could i do?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You may have set "ximagesink" (X Window System (No Xv)) as
        video-output. This means, that your cpu is doing all the work. Change
        it to "xvimagesink" (X Window System (X11/XShm/Xv)) in order to let
        your graphics card do the work.
      </p>

      <h3 id="faq1">
      Where can I set those things mentioned in the answer above?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Just execute gstreamer-properties (or in the menu: Multimedia
        Systems Selector) and change it there 
      </p>

      <h3 id="faq2">
      I have a iMac, Macbook Pro, ... with an ATI Graphics card in there
      and the colors are weird...
      </h3>
      <p>
        Thats ATI's fault, not mine!! ;) just change the video-output to custom
        and insert<br />
        ffmpegcolorspace ! video/x-raw-yuv,format=(fourcc)YV12 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink<br/>
        That should fix the wrong colors.. 
      </p>

      My webcam works with gstreamer, but does not with cheese... What's wrong?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Try to change from xvimagesink to ximagesink or vice-versa, maybe
        that does the wonder. 
      </p>

      <h3 id="faq4">
      My webcam works with ekiga, camorama, but not with cheese... What's wrong?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Try to see if it works with gstreamer-properties. If it works
        there, please fill a bug. Else bug the gstreamer guys ;) 
      </p>

      Do you know another Chuck Norris joke?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Of course! Chuck Norris has the greatest Poker-Face of all time.
        He won the 1983 World Series of Poker, despite holding only a Joker,
        a Get out of Jail Free Monopoloy card, a 2 of clubs, 7 of spades
        and a green #4 card from the game UNO. 
      </p>

      <h3 id="faq6">
      Where does cheese store my photos?
      </h3>
      <p>
        They are stored in ~/.gnome2/cheese/images. Videos are stored
        in ~/.gnome2/cheese/videos. 
      </p>

      <h3 id="faq7">
      My Quickcam Express (qc-usb driver) doesn't work with Cheese
      (or gstreamer), and I see errors like "Not enough buffers. We got 1,
      we want at least 2" in the Cheese output.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Try running qcset /dev/video0 compat=dblbuf to enable double buffer
        compatibility mode, then restarting Cheese.

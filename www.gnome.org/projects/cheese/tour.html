          Cheese is an program for the Gnome Desktop which allows you to take
          photos, videos, and anything else you can think of with your webcam.
          <br/>
          Just start it up
          and shoot! Gather all of your friends around, have some fun! Share
          your taken photos and videos with 'em!
          </p>

          The countdown widget will let you get into
          position, or wreck everything, before the photo that you want is
          taken. The visual countdown will appear at the bottom of the image,
          and will give you time to press the take photo button, and
          get ready! So if you need to put your eye makeup on, be fast, you
          just have 3 seconds!

          Cheese does not only allow you to take great photos, it also allows you to take
          videos. Effects, sharing, and everything that you can do with photos you can
          also do with videos as well. Instead of preparing for that one
          moment, invite some friends, record your session and laugh about it afterwards.
          So Mr. Kubrick, go ahead and present us your new
          Hollywood-movie! Or do you want to be a music star and record the
          video to your new song?

          <p>
          You have several webcams? You can't stop taking photos of yourself
          and your friends? The only reason you have USB-Ports is to attach
          Webcams?<br/>
          With Cheese 2.24, you now can switch between your installed webcams
          with just one click! Just open the shiny new preference dialog and
          choose your favoured webcam. You can also set the resolution of
          your webcam there! So, get all your webcams out of your locker,
          attach them to your computer and play with them!

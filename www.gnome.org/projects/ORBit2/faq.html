      <td align="left" valign="top">a.) How does a client connect to a server?</td>
      <td align="left" valign="top">This is a well known problem in CORBA (more precisely in any distributed object system). It is commonly known under the 
            term "bootstrapping". In general, object references can be obtained from a <a href="http://orbit-resource.sourceforge.net/naming.html">Name Service</a> 
            (or a <a href="http://orbit-resource.sourceforge.net/tradingobject.html">Trading Object Service</a>), but a name service (thanks to the clear design of CORBA) 
            is itself an object. So, how do you get the reference to the name service if it is itself an object ?<br>
            <br>
            The standard solution for a client, finding a first object reference to a server is by exchanging an <b>Interoperable 
            Object Reference (IOR)</b>.
The server process produces an IOR of the created object by using the method
             object_to_string(). The generated string, also called stringified
object reference, can be transfered by any kind of              media, like
email, HTTP, NFS, filesystem, or even as a message in a bottle ;-) . The
client process reads the IOR from the medium and             converts it
back into its binary representation via string_to_object(). Afterwards the
client holds a valid object reference to the             server and thus
is able to invoke methods in the usual way.<br>
            <br> 
            Until now non-standard ways to solve this bootstrapping issue
have been introduced by different ORBs. One example              is the Visibroker
Location Service. The ORB registers each object at a central service by a
proprietary _bind() method. The discovery of the service is done        
     by network broadcasts. The drawback of this mechanism is that the information
about the objects is stored in a central table.              The table needs
to be updated on a regular basis. This is necessary because of malicious
objects not cleanly deregistering.             If the broadcast interval
is to short the updates will cause a lot of noise on the network. If the
interval is to long the table              contains zombie objects. Such
kind of proprietary solutions exists for many major CORBA implementations.<br>
            <br> 
            Ideally the method resolve_initial_references() could be used
to find a reference to the naming service. Therefore the ORB must be    
        able to read IORs without requiring the developer to write some additional
code. In the past each ORB had its own command              line parameters
to pass IORs to the ORB's core (ORBit: ORBNamingIOR=IOR:.....). The <b>Interoperable Naming Service (INS) </b> specification
            (<a href="http://cgi.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/99-12-03">ptc/99-12-03</a>) introduces the standardized command line parameter <b>-ORBInitRef</b> to achieve this.<br>
            <br>
            <pre>yourclientapp -ORBInitRef NameService=IOR_of_naming_service</pre> 
            The only trick is to pass argc and argv to the ORB_init() call
of the ORB, so that the ORB's core can extract the relevant parameters.  
           Afterwards the call<br>
            <br>
            <pre>nsobj = resolve_initial_references("NameService");</pre> 
            returns the desired object reference. The INS specification defines,
besides the IOR, other human readable object references.<br>
            <pre>corbaloc:iiop://IIOPVersion@hostname:port/ObjectKey</pre> 
            This offers the possibility for a client to point to a server
object just by providing a human readable address. Another proposed naming
scheme is              corbaname, which refers to a naming service running
on the host the, specified by hostname.<br>
            <pre>corbaname://hostname#a/b/obj</pre> 
            The a/b/obj specifies a Name, i.e. a sequence of NameComponents,
which resolves to an object reference.             These mechanisms will
extremly improve the whole bootstrapping process and finally solve the problem,
as it has been one of the most annoying              issues in the past.
There are are also a few critics of the human readable object reference corbaloc.
They think that the fact of having opaque IORs is              weakened by
the INS specification. Specifying protocol details, like port numbers or
protocol version numbers, can result in references to become            
invalid when the protocol, used for transportation is exchanged. The Object
URLs have to be extended to support the new protocol information,       
      whereas IORs always remain the same, a sequence of numbers.<br>
            <br>
            The CVS HEAD version of ORBit has a partial implementation of the INS specification (see <a href="http://orbit-resource.sourceforge.net/naming.html">NameService</a>).<br>
            <br>

      <td>b.) How can I specify default parameters in IDL?</td>
      <td>IDL
does not allow to specifiy default parameters. There are mainly two reasons
for that. First, IDL is some kind of least common denominator of all the
languages             for which a CORBA mapping is available. Many languages
do not support the concept of default parameters and thus have difficulties
in supporting this              feature in the mapping. And second, default
parameters are not really necessary. The designer of an interface can easily
split such funtionality into             two or more separate methods (Attention:
Overloading is not supported for the same reasons, so that methods must have
different names).       </td>
   </tr>
   <tr align="left" valign="top">
      <td>c.) How can I get the IP address of a cient/server object in CORBA?</td>
      <td>The
IP address (as well as the port number or any other protocol related feature)
is hidden in the IOR (Interoperable Object Reference). The              reason
for this opacity is that CORBA can use any protocol for transportation of
requests between object instances. The GIOP (General Inter              ORB
Protocol) is independent from any special network protocol. The IIOP (Internet
Inter ORB Protocol) is a translation of GIOP into              TCP/IP. IIOP
support is not a mandatory feature of an ORB, but because of the Internet
it has become a must for any ORB to implement. If we start relying      
      on the presence of a specific protocol the original intention becomes
weakened and may render object references, valid today, invalid in the future.
             (see <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/%7Eschmidt/TAO">TAO</a> (The ACE ORB, ACE - Adaptive Communication Environment) for an ORB which supports pluggable protocols)

      <td>Configure the package with the following command:
         <pre>./configure --prefix=~/orbit_test_dir --exec-prefix=~/orbit_test_dir</pre>
         Where orbit_test_dir is an arbitrary subdirectory. Then call make and make install,
         which will copy ORBit to the specified directory. Finally you just need
         to adapt your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables by adding
         ~/orbit_test_dir/bin to PATH and ~/orbit_test_dir/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH respectively.

   <tr align="left" valign="top">
      <td>b.) I can't connect to my remote objects ?</td>
      <td>A GNOME <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/2000-June/thread.html#00439">security discussion</a>
led to disabling IIOP over IP server        sockets (i.e. ports) per default.
Instead either UNIX domain sockets or shared memory for       interprocess
communication are used. This disables communcation over the network but prevents
the system from Denial of Service attacks. If you want to use ORBit     
 over the network you need to turn it on again. This can either be done in
/etc/orbitrc (system-wide settings), in ~/.orbitrc (user's settings),   
   or on a per application basis by passing a parameter to the ORB.     
 For Solution one and two you need to put ORBIIOPIPv4=1 into one of the orbitrc
files. Controlling the settings for each application can be done by providing 
      ORBIIOPIPv4=1 at the command-line to your client/server application
and passing the argc and argv parameters to the CORBA_ORB_init() call (default-handling).<br>
      You can check the setting with the command: <b>netstat -ao | grep LISTEN</b>.
       You should not have any orbit related sockets in listen mode (a line:
"unix 0 [ ACC ] STREAM LISTENING XXXX /tmp/orbit-USER/orb-YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
should not appear)    </td></tr>

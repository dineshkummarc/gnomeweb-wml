>Introduction</H1

>&#13;ORBit is an efficient, free C-based ORB, compliant to CORBA version 2.2.
CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. CORBA in many
ways is a successor to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) system common on UNIX
and other systems: the best oneline description of CORBA is that it is
"Object Orientated RPC".</P
><P
>&#13;The key point about CORBA is that it provides a way for two programs
to communicate information. The CORBA mechanism allows these two
programs to be running on <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>different machines</I
> and written
in <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>different programming</I
> languages while safely (and
portably) exchanging data. They also could be running in the same program, 
on the same machine, in which case the process of communication is much 
quickeras ORBit recognises that it does not need to open any communication channel.
</P
><P
>&#13;ORBit has some important features which distinguish it from other
CORBA implementations. Firstly it is primarily a C-based
implementation (using the standard C mapping), which many other CORBA
implementations do not cater to. Secondly it is a fast
implementation, meaning that it moves information on and off the
communication channel into the programs quickly. Thirdly it is
efficient in terms of its memory usage, meaning it can be run on small
machines.  Fourthly it works, and works in real life problems. Finally
it is free software, that is free in terms of an open license to
change the source code. This means that a number of different people
(both academics and commerical people) can contribute to the source
code and that bugs and problems can be fixed quickly. ORBit
unsurprisingly is therefore licensed under the GNU Public License
(GPL). More information about how the terms of this license affect you
can be found in the FAQ, and you're encouraged to read the actual GPL
text that comes in the distribution
</P
><P
> The CORBA mechanism is ideal for classic client/server
applications, say a graphical client GUI communicating to a database
server, or much simpler applications, such as one program asking for a
mail service from the CORBA system. ORBit was made principly for the
latter case: that is communicating information between different
programs running in a desktop enviroment (the Gnome enviroment). ORBit
is a fully blown generic ORB and can be used in many other
applications outside of the gnome desktop - there is absolutely no
requirement to be running Gnome for ORBit.
</P
><P
>&#13;This documentation is aimed principly at getting people with C
programming experience started with ORBit and some discussion about
the challenges of writing ORB aware software. If you are a looking for
a more fluffy description about what CORBA is I would start at the
Resource section below.  If you want to know the technical
nitty-gritty about ORBit, go to the source code, or hang out on the
ORBit mailing list.
</P
><P
>&#13;It is also hoped that this documentation will be a starting point for
a more technical orientated documentation about how ORBit is
structured and the internal functions.

what is going on, always go to the source code (with any luck, it will
have documentation) or the C mapping document at the OMG.  If you
think there is mistake with this documentation, please email me. If
you would like to contribute an example or another chapter, please
also get in contact, or post to the orbit mailing list.

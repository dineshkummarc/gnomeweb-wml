>What is CORBA?</H2
><P
>&#13;CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture,
standardized by the Object Management Group (OMG). It consists of an
Interface Definition Language (IDL), language bindings and protocols
to allow interoperation between applications

>What is ORBit?</H2
><P
> ORBit is an implementation of CORBA, which is used (amongst
other things) in the GNOME project. Active development is done for
ORBit2, being a clean re-implementation from scratch. The old ORBit
code is no longer maintained. </P

>Why aren't you using ILU/MICO/TAO?</H2
><P
> Most
of GNOME is written in C, both for performance reasons, and because
C++ still isn't as portable and widely available. So integration with
CORBA should use the IDL C mapping, which rules out TAO and MICO. ILU
was ruled out because the license appeared as too restrictive at the
time for free software.  </P

>Is ORBit stable?</H2
><P
>&#13;ORBit is used in pretty much any GNOME application, which gives quite
some testing for the features used. Other features have seen little or
no testing.

>Does ORBit work with other ORBs?</H2
><P
>&#13;Yes. This is one of the primary features of CORBA, and available
through the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP). There is one pitfall:
ORBit has a proprietary security mechanism to authenticate clients. If
interoperability is desired then you might have to figure out a 
work-around for this.

>What license does ORBit get distributed with and how does it affect me?</H2
><P
>&#13;The idl compiler is <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>GNU Public licensed</I
> (
<SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>GPL</SPAN
>).  The libaries are <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Library
GPL</I
> (<SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>L-GPL</SPAN
>) licensed. The code generated
from the idl compiler have no restriction. Bascially this means you
can use ORBit in your own applications (including proprietary
applications), the only restriction being that people whom you
distribute your working code to must be able to update the ORBit
libraries at will.  If you wish to modify and distribute the ORBit idl
compiler you have to distribute that modification under the GPL.

>Why doesn't ORBit compile with my cc compiler ?</H2
><P
>&#13;ORBit uses some of the extensions that gcc allows, including
assignment to casts and void * pointer arithmetic. More current versions
of ORBit will remove these and eventually it is likely the ORBit will
compile with all ANSI C compilers.
</P
><P
>&#13;You can always install gcc and use that. This will always work.

>What is a language binding?</H2
><P
>&#13;A language binding defines how to use the IDL operations in a
programming language. There is a client-side mapping which explains
how to call operations, and a server-side mapping which defines how to
implement them. The client side mapping is largely
implementation-independent.
</P
><P
>&#13;On the server side, different 'object adapters' are provided by ORB
vendors; only the 'Portable Object Adapter' (POA) implemented by ORBit
allows portability between CORBA implementations.

>What language bindings does ORBit provide?</H2
><P
>&#13;At the moment only the C binding. Python and Perl bindings are being
seriously talked about. Bindings (in various degrees of completeness)
are also available for C++, Lisp, Pascal, Python, Ruby, and TCL; others are in-progress.

>Does ORBit have DII and DSI?</H2
><P

the use of dynAny, which is not supported yet.

>Does ORBit provide a naming service?</H2
><P
>&#13;Yes. In addition, it is possible to use a third-party naming service,
e.g. using the --ORBNamingIOR command line option. The 'Interoperable
Naming' specification is not yet supported.

>Can you encrypt a CORBA connection?</H2
><P
>&#13;Yes, ORBit supports IIOP over SSL. the implementation is based on
OpenSSL and support client and server side authentication.  Frank
O'Dwyer did initial work on this for ORBit.  </P

  The examples are cut-and-paste from the generated html from the
orbit.sgml (remember that sgml treats & as a special character, so you
have to escape that in the docbook source as &amp;).

  The echo example is from Ewan Birney.

  The calculator example is from Michael Launsch with edits from Ewan
Birney.

  The configure system was contributed by Ronald Garcia and Ewan,
simplified by Frank Rehberger later.

  All the code could probably be improved along with the docs. If you
have a better way of expressing this, please email Ewan Birney 
(birney@sanger.ac.uk) with the changes, preferably as patches to orbit.sgml
and the example code.

Thanks

  INSTALLATION
  ------------

The source code works with ORBit 2.2.x and probably all versions of ORBit2.
You need to install orbit first. Go to http://www.gnome.org to find your
closest mirror, then download it. For orbit to work you need glib 1.2.10
or higher (preferably 1.2). Go to ftp://ftp.gtk.org to get that.

Install glib
Install orbit2

You may well have already done this.

Now, just go

    make

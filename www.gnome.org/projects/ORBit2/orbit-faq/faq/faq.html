>How does a client connect to a server?</H2
><P
>&#13;    This is a well known problem in CORBA (more precisely in any
    distributed object system). It is commonly known under the term
    "bootstrapping". In general, object references can be
    obtained from a <TT
CLASS="application"
>Name Service</TT
> (or a
    <TT
CLASS="application"
>Trading Object Service</TT
>), but a name
    service (thanks to the clear design of CORBA) is itself an
    object. So, how do you get the reference to the name service if it
    is itself an object ?  </P
><P
> The standard solution for a client, finding a first object
    reference to a server is by exchanging an Interoperable Object
    Reference (IOR). The server process produces an IOR of the created
    object by using the method <DIV

    stringified object reference, can be transfered by any kind of
    media, like email, HTTP, NFS, filesystem, or even as a message in
    a bottle ;-) . The client process reads the IOR from the medium
    and converts it back into its binary representation via

> Afterwards the client holds a
    valid object reference to the server and thus is able to invoke
    methods in the usual way.  </P
><P
> Until now non-standard ways to solve this bootstrapping
    issue have been introduced by different ORBs. One example is the
    Visibroker Location Service. The ORB registers each object at a
    central service by a proprietary _bind() method. The discovery of
    the service is done by network broadcasts. The drawback of this
    mechanism is that the information about the objects is stored in a
    central table.  The table needs to be updated on a regular
    basis. This is necessary because of malicious objects not cleanly
    deregistering.  If the broadcast interval is to short the updates
    will cause a lot of noise on the network. If the interval is to
    long the table contains zombie objects. Such kind of proprietary
    solutions exists for many major CORBA implementations.  </P
><P
> Ideally the method resolve_initial_references() could be
    used to find a reference to the naming service. Therefore the ORB
    must be able to read IORs without requiring the developer to write
    some additional code. In the past each ORB had its own command
    line parameters to pass IORs to the ORB's core (ORBit:
    ORBNamingIOR=IOR:.....). <TT

    Service (INS) </TT

>This offers the possibility for a client to point to a
    server object just by providing a human readable address. Another
    proposed naming scheme is corbaname, which refers to a naming
    service running on the host the, specified by hostname.

><I
>corbaname://hostname#a/b/obj</I
></TT
> The
    a/b/obj specifies a Name, i.e. a sequence of NameComponents, which
    resolves to an object reference.  These mechanisms will extremly
    improve the whole bootstrapping process and finally solve the
    problem, as it has been one of the most annoying issues in the
    past. There are are also a few critics of the human readable
    object reference corbaloc. They think that the fact of having
    opaque IORs is weakened by the INS specification. Specifying
    protocol details, like port numbers or protocol version numbers,
    can result in references to become invalid when the protocol, used
    for transportation is exchanged. The Object URLs have to be
    extended to support the new protocol information, whereas IORs
    always remain the same, a sequence of numbers. </P

NAME="DefaultParameterInIDL"
></A
>How can I specify default parameters in IDL?</H2
><P
>&#13;    IDL does not allow to specifiy default parameters. There are
    mainly two reasons for that. First, IDL is some kind of least
    common denominator of all the languages for which a CORBA mapping
    is available. Many languages do not support the concept of default
    parameters and thus have difficulties in supporting this feature
    in the mapping. And second, default parameters are not really
    necessary. The designer of an interface can easily split such
    funtionality into two or more separate methods (Attention:
    Overloading is not supported for the same reasons, so that methods
    must have different names). </P

NAME="GettingIpAdressOfObject"
></A
>How can I get the IP address of a cient/server object in
    CORBA?</H2
><P
> The IP address (as well as the port number or any other
    protocol related feature) is hidden in the IOR (Interoperable
    Object Reference). The reason for this opacity is that CORBA can
    use any protocol for transportation of requests between object
    instances. The GIOP (General Inter ORB Protocol) is independent
    from any special network protocol. The IIOP (Internet Inter ORB
    Protocol) is a translation of GIOP into TCP/IP. IIOP support is
    not a mandatory feature of an ORB, but because of the Internet it
    has become a must for any ORB to implement. If we start relying on
    the presence of a specific protocol the original intention becomes
    weakened and may render object references, valid today, invalid in
    the future. (see TAO (The ACE ORB, ACE - Adaptive Communication
    Environment) for an ORB which supports pluggable protocols)

NAME="why_cant_i_keep_a_pointer_to_an_argument"
></A
>Why can't I keep a pointer to an argument ?</H2
><P
>&#13;      If you are implementing a CORBA method, often you are sent data
      and wish to keep it around; one scenario might be where you are
      sent a sequence as an 'in' or 'inout' argument:

      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>static void
impl_MyModule_myMethod (PortableServer_Servant            servant,
			const CORBA_sequence_CORBA_octet *data,
			CORBA_Environment                *ev)
{
	/* This code contains an error */
	g_hash_table_insert (my_hash, data);
}</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
 
      The lifetime of the 'data' variable is only that of the method
      invocation. What this means is that when the invocation comes in
      across the wire - the arguments are de-marshaled to temporary
      storage.  The method is then invoked - on the data, and then the
      data is freed after the invocation ( to avoid leaking it, or the
      user having to explicitely free it ).
      </P
><P
>&#13;      Thus - if you want to keep a pointer to data; you need to copy
      it to insert it into the table. ORBit2 provides a helpful
      convenience function to copy any value, specified by type:

      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>{
	CORBA_sequence_CORBA_octet *copy;

	copy = ORBit_copy_value (data, TC_CORBA_sequence_CORBA_octet);
	g_hash_table_insert (my_hash, copy);

> led to disabling IIOP over IP server
   sockets (i.e. ports) per default. Instead either UNIX domain
   sockets or shared memory for interprocess communication are
   used. This disables communcation over the network but prevents the
   system from Denial of Service attacks. If you want to use ORBit
   over the network you need to turn it on again. This can either be
   done in /etc/orbitrc (system-wide settings), in ~/.orbitrc (user's
   settings), or on a per application basis by passing a parameter to
   the ORB. For Solution one and two you need to put ORBIIOPIPv4=1
   into one of the orbitrc files. Controlling the settings for each
   application can be done by providing ORBIIOPIPv4=1 at the
   command-line to your client/server application and passing the argc
   and argv parameters to the CORBA_ORB_init() call
   (default-handling).  You can check the setting with the command:
   <B
CLASS="command"
>netstat -ao | grep LISTEN</B
>. You should not have
   any orbit related sockets in listen mode (a line: "unix 0 [ ACC ]
   STREAM LISTENING XXXX /tmp/orbit-USER/orb-YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY" should

><P
>&#13;   Well - partly due to encapsulation. Encapsulation often carries a
   cost; in ORBit stable there are several layers. Even though the
   stubs and skels are substantialy unrolled, there are a considerable
   amount of method calls, and lots of wasteful indirection.
   </P
><P
>&#13;   In ORBit2 we can hide an _extremely_ optimized, top to bottom to
   the wire generic marshaler behind ORBit_small_invoke_stub. This
   would be totaly private to the ORB, maintaining ORB encapsulation,
   but giving us buckets of room for optimization.
   </P
><P
>&#13;   Secondarily, in ORBit stable the stubs and skels are massively
   unrolled, giving not only a size penalty but also a speed penalty
   in terms of the processors instruction cache (Icache). In contrast
   ORBit2 maintains a far smaller Icached working set, since the
   generated code that is different per method is tiny, and the same
   generic code is executed to do the marshaling for each method.
   </P
><P
>&#13;   Hence - although currently what performance tests we have suggest
   that ORBit2 is ~20% slower than ORBit stable, it will be possible (
   in a totaly binary compatible fashion ) to tweak and optimize the
   marshal / de-marshal process to make it arbitarily fast.

>&#13;   This (unfinished) option allows the ORB to be configured to run in
   a slightly slower, but 'cleaner' mode. Purify is a tool that
   performs advanced memory debugging, and it will detect many common
   errors. Some of the things ORBit2 can do eg. using uninitialized
   stack space as a source of randomness will flag false positives as
   purify errors ( an Uninitialized Memory Read or UMR ). Enabling
   this flag ensures that all such memory will be blanked first before
   being read.  This also applies to initializing return values before
   returning them, even on exceptions - a case where CORBA specifies
   an uninitialized return value.
   </P

        FALSE, the _buffer and it's contents are not freed. This
        allows people to return static copies of their data which can
        be a big efficiency win.

><P
>&#13;	While _release works really well out of process, if you are
        writing library code, or code that might be used by another
        component in process - then the _release flag is a
        nightmare. The reason is quite simple; in the remote case, the
        data is copied to the wire, and the client receives a copy of
        which he controls the lifecycle. The problem is that in-proc,
        the client receives only a shallow copy and has no control (
        or idea ) of it's lifecycle.

	Thus you might return some data, and then in a later method
        alter the data - the client's copy then would contain bad
        information.

   One of the best books is Michi Henning's and Steve Vinoski's book:
   "Advanced CORBA Programming with C++" (ISBN
   0-201-37927-9). Although the title seems to address only for C++
   programmers it contains explanations of many fundamental concepts
   and is thus useful for a general understanding.

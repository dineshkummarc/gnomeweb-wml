<h1>GNOME Outreach Program: Accessibility - Tasks</h1>

<h2>Accessibility Testing</h2>

<p>
<b>Mentor:</b>: Willie Walker and Eitan Isaacson<br/>
</p>

<p>
See <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=519359">bug 519359</a> to track this task.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this USD$6K/6mo task is to develop a clear accessibility test
strategy/framework for GNOME and generate initial tests that use this
strategy/framework. The main goal is to make sure the GNOME desktop as a whole
provides compelling access via theming, keyboard access, assistive
technologies, etc.
</p>

<p>
The testing should provide automated tests that help identify and prevent
regressions as early as possible. These tests can consist of non-runtime tests
such as GLADE file linting as well as runtime tests that check for
accessibility hierarchy and accessibility event issues in running applications
(e.g., perhaps new assertions or targets to add to LDTP/Dogtail/Strongwind).
</p>

<p>
In addition to this work, the leader of this needs to champion a culture of
automated testing so that GNOME module maintainers understand the real benefit
of maintaining and using a high-quality test library.
</p>

<p>
Deliverables include the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The testing strategy/framework</li>
  <li>Identification/implementation of how this will fit into a "make check" target</li>
  <li>Tests that show how to verify accessibility support works for theming, keyboard navigation, and compelling access via the assistive technology suite of GNOME (e.g., Orca, GOK, Dasher, MouseTweaks, etc.). </li>
</ul>

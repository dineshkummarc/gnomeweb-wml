&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Q: What is gnome-pilot ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: A package aiming at offering as complete as possible
integration between your
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PalmPilot pda and the Gnome
desktop. This means a daemon for monitoring Sync
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requests, backup and file
installation capabilities and conduits for <a href="http://www.gnome.org">Gnome</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applications.
<p>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Q: Where can I get it ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Newest releases are available at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-pilot/download">http://www.gnome.org/gnome-pilot/download</a>
.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newest development code
is also available via anonymous CVS from the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnome&nbsp; CVS repository.
See&nbsp; <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html</a>
.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: GOB_CHECK&nbsp;missing ?</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A: GOB is the Gtk+ Object builder, that builds
.c and .h files from .gob files. You can find it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.5z.com/jirka/gob.html">http://www.5z.com/jirka/gob.html</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: I've got a XXX device, does that work with
gnome-pilot ?</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A: gnome-pilot should work with anything that
pilot-link works with, as the underlying
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communication is done by
pilot-link.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: As for Visors with USB support, check&nbsp; <a href="http://usbvisor.sourceforge.net/">http://usbvisor.sourceforge.net/</a>&nbsp;
for info on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connecting the Visor to
Linux via USB.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Q: I get "*** ERROR *** Cannot connect to GnomePilot
Daemons", huh ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: If you compiled gnome-pilot yourself, you probably
misconfigured your compile.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More specifically, the --sysconfdir
parameter to configure was most likely omitted.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try the following :
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $./autogen.sh --prefix=`gnome-config --prefix`
\</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -sysconfdir=`gnome-config --sysconfdir`</tt>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This should ensure, that
the .gnorba files end up where the CORBA nameserver can find them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you did not compile gnome-pilot
yourself, check manually that the <tt>gpilotd.gnorba </tt>file is placed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the other .gnorba
files. It should be in the same directory as eg. <tt>panel.gnorba</tt>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: All syncs end with timeout or SIGINT ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: This bug is known, no need to bug report it. However,
this is a very odd bug that has yet not
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been fixed (0.1.47 at the time of writing). The
bug only appears if gpilotd is started as a CORBA
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; service, eg.&nbsp; by starting pilot_applet before
gpilotd. If you manually (or pr. config) start gpilotd before
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other gnome-pilot tools, you should be safe and
sound, if not, please let <a href="mailto:deity@eskil.dk">me know</a> that
this also fails.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bug is sporadic, and may appear at one time,
and after watching a South Park episode be gone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again. Also, this bug is apparantly related to the
serial port, as you should no experience it with
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simulators such as <a href="http://xcopilot.cuspy.com">XCopilot</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPDATE: 20000114: This bug should now be fixed, as
of version 0.1.48.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: What is a SyncId ?</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A: The syncid is just a random number, that
identifies your machine. The pilot uses this number during
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sync to check if the last synchronize was with the
same machine as the current. Thus this number only
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has to be unique within the set of machines with
which you sync. In most cases, you won't have to set
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Q: What is "Synchronize Action" ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: The synchronize action determines how conduits
should transfer data between the local storage
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the handheld's storage. This setting can be
used to impose a certain action on the conduits.
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="80%" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td NOSAVE>Use conduit Settings
<p>&nbsp;</td>

<td>Use whatever the conduit is configured to do.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Synchronize</td>

<td>Call synchronize. This synchronizes db's at the record level. See note
below.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Copy from pilot</td>

<td>Call copy from pilot. The deletes the local storage, and then copies
all records from the pilot. See note below.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Copy to pilot</td>

<td>As copy from pilot, only the other way around. See note below.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Merge from pilot</td>

<td>Perform record level merge but do not modify/add records on the pilot.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Merge to pilot</td>

<td>Perform record level merge but do not modify/add records in the local
db.</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note : If the imposed action is not supported by
the conduit, no synchronization will happen. Also
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please note, that copy to/from pilot <i>deletes</i>
db's before proceeding. This can cause dataloss is the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; synchronization is ended prematurely.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most cases, "Use conduit settings" will be the
option you want.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Additional Note: This option may be removed.</i>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q: What is the "User Id" ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: The user id identifies your pilot. In multi user
environment (when gpilotd truly supports that), it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be used to match the pilot with you. When you
buy or reset your pilot, it has a ID=0. Normally, a
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pilot with ID=0 will mean just that, a blank slate.
Therefore, you should not use 0 as an ID.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have used the 3Com supplied software for Windows/Mac,
the pilot will have an ID set.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other sync packages might also set an ID, in this
case, try the "get from pilot" button in the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pilot-Link capplet. If this results in a ID=0, please
set it to another value, and press
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "send to pilot". Not doing this, will someday bring
trouble (we're talking about stuff like missing
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toilet paper and worse!)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: How do I install files ?/How does the file
conduit work ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: To install files, first, you must remember to
enable the file conduit. If this conduit is not enabled,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the installation will not happen. Once enabled,
there are three ways :
<ol>
<li>
Rightclick on prc/pdb files in GMC, there should be an option called <i>Install
Now </i>and <i>Install Later</i>. <i>Now</i> displays a box asking you
to press sync, <i>Later</i> queues the files till a later sync.</li>

<li>
Drag and drop files onto the panel applet.</li>

<li>
Run <tt>gpilot-install-file [-l|-n] [FILES] </tt>from commandline. The
-l corresponds to the <i>Install Later </i>in GMC, -n to <i>Install Now</i>.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: How do I use the backup conduit ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. When I delete or edit items in gnomecard, the
change is not reflected on the pilot?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: This is limitation of current gnomecard program.
There's no way for the address conduit to find
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out, which entries have been modified or deleted.
Changes in the gnomecard implementation will be
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required to add such functionality.
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Q. What are these strange garbage characters in
my gcrd file?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Certain characters need to be quoted to correctly
read/write vcard files. "=A0" represents "\n",
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "=3D" represents "=" etc., "=" by itself at the
end of the line means the entry is continued on the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next line.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Q: My AvantGo doens't start/work, que ?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: It has been reported, that eg. the Minstrel wireless
modem which apparently adds AvantGo to the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flash does not work, since
the main DB is not reported (since it's in flash). The temporary
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fix (making the conduit
start if another AvantGo base is present) also failed. Stay tuned
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for updates.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Q: Hot do I install periodically updated local DB's
?</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: If you eg. have a cron job that updates some .pdb's
locally, let the cronjob call
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gpilot-install-file
-l file1.pdb file2.pdb ...</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>that should do the trick.

><P
>Before you start implementing a conduit, there are certain
     things you have to think about. There are issues such as conduit
     type and whether or not the local application to which you'll
     sync is ready for it.</P

>Conduit type</A
></H2
><P
>First there is the conduit type. Depending on the
        functionality you wish to implement, your choices are the
        custom conduits and the syncabs conduits.</P
><P
>The custom conduit is good for simple databases, like
        the email database, in which all records from category
        "Outgoing" are to be mailed, and moved to category "Deleted"
        and new mail to be inserted into "Inbox". The single record
        isn't synchronized with respect to its contents.</P
><P
>SyncAbs conduits are however tailored for databases like
        the address book. In this, an existing record can undergo
        certain modifications such as contents change, category
        movement, deletion, creation etc.  All this has the be
        compared against the local instance of the records, and in
        each case (there are twenty), actions such as inserting the
        record to the pilot, modifying local flags etc, are to be
        taken.</P
><P
>Where a custom conduit has to implement its own
        synchronisation logic, which is fine to many databases, most
        databases like memopad, calendar, expense etc. will benefit
        from a SyncAbs conduit, where implementing about methods gives
        you an almost complete conduit.</P

>Local application issues</A
></H2
><P
>Next problem ; is your application ready for the conduit
        ? A pilot record is identified by a 32 bit unsigned integer,
        and in order to easily find a local record given the pilot
        record, it is easier to compare the ID with an local
        ID. Also has the local record changed since last ?</P
><P
>So if possible, it is often desirable to add two fields
        to the local records, namely the pilot id and a status flag
        (unless the record already has something useable for this,
        eg. a last-modified ield). In the case of GnomeCal, calendar
        records were simply given these two fields.</P
><P
>If on the other hand, you do not have the possibility to
        add fields, you'll have to in some other way, match local
        records with the ID info. Keeping a seperate map is one
        feasible way of achieving this..</P
><P
>The last resort is to decode a given pilot record, and
        map it against the local records, a cumbersome way.</P

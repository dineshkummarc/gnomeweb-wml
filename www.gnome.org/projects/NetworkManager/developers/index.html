	<h2>So you want to hack on NetworkManager?</h2>
	<p>First, join the mailing lists: <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list">http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/networkmanager-list</a>.</p>
	<p>Second, read the <a href="design_goals.html">Design Goals</a> of NetworkManager to get an idea of why things work the way they do.</p>
	<p>Next, grab NetworkManager from CVS HEAD.  To checkout and build from CVS HEAD:<br>
	<code>
		<kbd>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome login</kbd><br><kbd>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co NetworkManager</kbd><br><kbd>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var</kbd><br><kbd>make</kbd><br><kbd>make install</kbd>
	</code>
	</p>

	<h2>Actually hacking on it</h2>
	<p>If you make changes to NetworkManager, create the patch using a Unified diff format (ie, diff -u) and mail the patch to the NetworkManager list.  Others on the list may make suggestions, please take these into consideration.  Eventually, your patch can be checked into NetworkManager CVS.</p>

	<h2>Stuff to work on</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>WPA support:</b> please see <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/networkmanager-list/2005-September/msg00073.html">this message</a> from the mailing list for a general idea of how WPA support should get integrated.  The general idea first to simply spawn a new instance of wpa_supplicant when NM connects to an AP that needs WPA, generating a config file on-the-fly.  Normal WEP should still be done by NM.  Eventually, we want to talk to wpa_supplicant over its control socket like the wpa_cli program does.</li>
	<li><b>libnl support:</b> Check out <a href="http://people.suug.ch/~tgr/libnl/">libnl</a>.  Using it rather than callouts to /sbin/ip would allow us to get rid of most of the code in the system-specific backends.  Some of this has already been prototyped, and it works just fine.  This should be pretty easy.</li>
	<li><b>Devices as GObjects:</b> though NetworkManager is written in C, it could benefit from some object-oriented features that glib provides.  The code would be a lot cleaner and more exentsible to things like Bluetooth devices if the NMDevice object was GObject-derived.  Specific features of wireless, wired, etc devices could be exposed through subclasses of a GObject-derived NMDevice.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Using NetworkManager</h2>
	<p>Once the NetworkManager service is started, and the applet is running, using NetworkManager is a piece of cake.  For information on how to get the service started, see the <a href="../admins/">administrators</a> page.  NetworkManager will scan for available wireless networks.  To view the list of available networks, simply click on the applet.</p> 
	<p>NetworkManager will automatically connect to networks it knows about, but you will need to manually connect to a network at least once.  Simply select the network from the list, and NetworkManager will automatically attempt to connect.  If the network requires an encryption key, NetworkManager will prompt for one.  Once the correct key is input, the connection will be made.</p>
	<p>To switch wireless networks, simply choose another one from the applet's menu.</p>

	<h2>Supported Wireless Hardware</h2>
	<p>A list of the wireless cards and drivers that NetworkManager interoperates with can be found here: <a href="http://live.gnome.org/NetworkManagerHardware">http://live.gnome.org/NetworkManagerHardware</a>.<p>

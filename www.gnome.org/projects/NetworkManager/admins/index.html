	<h1>Administrators</h1>
	<h2>Deployment</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager is designed to be fully automatic.  In order to do this, its services must be started.  Simply start the <kbd>NetworkManager</kbd> service.  NetworkManager ships with initscripts to do this for most distributions.  If your distribution is not supported, we would appreciate patches to include support for your distribution of choice.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager is designed to be secure, but that does not obsolete standard network security practices.  Security must be implemented in each network.  NetworkManager currently supports WEP encrypted networks, and support for WPA encryption is planned in the near future.</p>
<!--

	There should be content on <em>lock down</em>

	<h2>VPN</h2>
	<p>NetworkManager has pluggable support for VPN.  There is support for vpnc at the moment.  Support for other vpn clients is welcomed.</p>
	<p>NetworkManager makes deployment of VPN easy.  It supports Cisco .pcf files, so administrators may simply distribute .pcf files to users.  The user is able to double click the .pcf file and NetworkManager will import the correct settings for the VPN.</p>
	<p>Additionally, NetworkManager can export VPN connections to a .pcf file.  Simply create a network in the VPN Connections menu, and then click on the Export button.</p>

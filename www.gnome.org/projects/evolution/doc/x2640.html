    <p>Of course, you'll want to use the calendar to do more than find out what day it is. This section will tell you how to schedule appointments, set alarms, and determine appointment recurrence. If you have installed the Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange, you can also read <a href="x3270.html">the Section called <i>Scheduling Appointments with Free/Busy</i> in the chapter called <i>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</i></a> to learn about how to take full advantage of the collaborative group scheduling functions available on the Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>

    <div class="sect2">
      <h2 class="sect2"><a name="usage-calendar-apts-basic" id="usage-calendar-apts-basic"></a>Creating appointments</h2>

      <p>To create a new appointment, select <b class="guimenu">File</b>-&gt;<b class="guisubmenu">New</b>-&gt;<b class="guimenuitem">Appointment</b> or click the <b class="guibutton">New Appointment</b> button on the left end of the toolbar. The <span class="interface">New Appointment</span> dialog will pop up with the menu bar, tool bar, and window full of choices for you.</p>

      <div class="tip">
        <a name="new-appointment-shortcut" id="new-appointment-shortcut"></a>

        <table class="tip" width="100%" border="0">

          <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>

            <td align="left" valign="top">
              <p>If you don't need to enter more information than the date and time of the appointment, you just click in any blank space in the calendar and start typing. You can enter other information later with the appointment editor.</p>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>Your appointment must have a starting and ending date (by default, today) but you can choose whether to give it starting and ending times or to mark it as an <tt class="guilabel"><b>All day event</b></tt>. An <tt class="guilabel"><b>All day event</b></tt> appears at the top of a day's appointment list, in the grey header under the date, rather than inside it. That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit inside each other. For example, a conference might be an all day appointment, and the meetings at the conference would be timed appointments. Of course, appointments with specific starting and ending times can also overlap. When they do they're displayed as multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.</p>

      <p><tt class="application">Evolution</tt> supports the use of timezones. If you share calendar files with friends or co-workers, it is quite possible you will need to configure your timezone. To configure your timezone:</p>

      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          <p>Select <b class="guimenu">Tools</b>-&gt;<b class="guimenuitem">Settings</b>, and click the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Calendar And Tasks</b></tt> icon in the settings dialog.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Click the <b class="guibutton">Globe</b> button in the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Time</b></tt> section, located in the <tt class="guilabel"><b>General</b></tt> tab.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Each red dot represents a major city. Click a dot and click <b class="guibutton">OK</b> to select your time zone.</p>
        </li>
      </ol><br />
      <br />

      <p>You can also configure timezone information specific to the Start and End time in each appointment. To do that, simply create a new appointment and click on a globe to customize the timezone that the time exists in. For example, if you live in New York but have a telephone meeting set for noon with someone in California, you need to make sure that you're not calling each other a few hours off. Setting time-zones on a per-appointment basis helps avoid that potential confusion.</p>

      <p><tt class="guilabel"><b>Classification</b></tt> only applies to calendars on a network. <tt class="guilabel"><b>Public</b></tt> is the default category, and a public appointment can be viewed by anyone on the calendar sharing network. <tt class="guilabel"><b>Private</b></tt> denotes one level of security, and <tt class="guilabel"><b>Confidential</b></tt> an even higher level.</p>

      <p><tt class="application">Evolution</tt> can handle free/busy scheduling Using the Ximian Connector on a Microsoft Exchange 2000 server. For more information about Ximian Connector, see <a href="c2925.html">the chapter called <i>The Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange</i></a>.</p>

      <p>To set your appointment to be free or busy, simply click the box in the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Show Time As</b></tt> section in the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Appointment Editor</b></tt>.</p>

      <p><tt class="application">Evolution</tt> lets you categorize your appointments, which can help if you lead a busy life. The bottom section of the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Appointment</b></tt> tab is where your categorization is done.</p>

      <p>Clicking on the <b class="guibutton">Categories</b> button opens up the category list. To associate a category to an appointment, simply click the check box.</p>

      <p>Once you've selected your categories, click <b class="guibutton">OK</b> to assign these categories to the appointment. The categories you selected are now listed in the text box to the right of the <b class="guibutton">Categories...</b> button.</p>

      <p>The <tt class="guilabel"><b>Recurrence</b></tt> tab lets you describe repetition in appointments ranging from once every day up to once every 100 years. You can then choose a time and date when the appointment will stop recurring, and, under <tt class="guilabel"><b>Exceptions</b></tt>, pick individual days when the appointment will <i class="emphasis">not</i> recur. Make your selections from left to right, and you'll form a sentence: "Every two weeks on Monday and Friday until January 3, 2003" or "Every month on the first Friday for 12 occurrences."</p>

      <p>Once you're done with all those settings, click on the disk icon in the toolbar to save and close the appointment editor window. If you want, you can alter an appointment summary in the calendar view by clicking on it and typing.

        <p>To schedule an appointment, you'll first need people's free/busy information.

Otherwise, each person will have to email you their schedule files and you will have to incorporate them into your calendar.</p>

        <p>Regardless of how you get the information, Ximian Evolution will display it in the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Scheduling</b></tt> tab. The pending appointment time will appear in white with bold black borders. Each attendee's free and busy times appear color-coded next to their names in the attendee list.</p>

        <p>Adjust the meeting time, either by dragging the meeting borders or by using the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Autopick</b></tt> buttons to choose a time automatically, then click <b class="guibutton">Save and Close</b>. Attendees on an Exchange server will have the appointment updated automatically; others will receive email notification of any change in plans.</p>

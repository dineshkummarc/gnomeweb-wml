>&#13;        Your appointment must have a starting and ending date (by
        default, today) but you can choose whether to give it
        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <TT

><B
>All
        day event</B
></TT
>. An <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>All day event</B
></TT
>
        appears at the top of a day's appointment list, in the grey header under the date, rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day appointment, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        appointments.  Of course, appointments with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.

>&#13;	<TT
CLASS="application"

	timezones.  If you share calendar files with friends or

	your timezone.  To configure your timezone:

	    </P
></LI
></OL
>
      </P
><P
>&#13;	You can also configure timezone information specific to the
	Start and End time in each appointment.  To do that, simply
	create a new appointment and click on a globe to customize the
	timezone that the time exists in. For example, if you live in
	New York but have a telephone meeting set for noon with
	someone in California, you need to make sure that you're not
	calling each other a few hours off.  Setting time-zones on a
	per-appointment basis helps avoid that potential confusion.

>&#13;	  To schedule an appointment, you'll first need people's
	  free/busy information.  If you're using the Ximian Connector
	  for Microsoft Exchange, all of the information is already
	  available to you in the Global Address List. Otherwise, each
	  person will have to email you their schedule files and you
	  will have to incorporate them into your calendar.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          Regardless of how you get the information, Ximian Evolution
          will display it in the <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>Scheduling</B
></TT
> tab.
          The pending appointment time will appear in white with bold
          black borders.  Each attendee's free and busy times appear
          color-coded next to their names in the attendee list.
	</P

>&#13;          Adjust the meeting time, either by dragging the meeting
          borders or by using the <TT

          buttons to choose a time automatically, then click
          <B
CLASS="guibutton"
>Save and Close</B
>.  Attendees on an
          Exchange server will have the appointment updated
          automatically; others will receive email notification of any
          change in plans.

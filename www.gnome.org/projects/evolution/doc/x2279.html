    <p>If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find yourself performing the same search again and again, consider a vFolder. vFolders, or virtual folders, are an advanced way of viewing your email messages within <tt class="application">Ximian Evolution</tt>. If you get a lot of mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders can help you stay on top of things.</p>

    <p>A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you set it up like a filter. In other words, while a conventional folder actually contains messages, a vFolder is a view of messages that may be in several different folders. The messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of criteria you choose in advance.</p>

    <p>As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are deleted, <tt class="application">Ximian Evolution</tt> will automatically place them in and remove them from the vFolder contents list. When you delete a message, it gets erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as any vFolders which display it.</p>

    <p>Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and students. The more mail you need to organize, the less you can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an organizational system that's not flexible enough. vFolders make for better organization because they can accept overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing systems can't.</p>

            <p>If you use remote email storage like IMAP or Microsoft Exchange, and have created vFolders to search through them, the Unmatched vFolder will follow your lead, and search the remote folders as well. If you do not create any vFolders that search in remote mail stores, the Unmatched vFolder will not search in them either.</p>

      <p><b>Example 2. Using Folders, Searches, and vFolders</b></p>

      <p>To organize his mailbox, Jim sets up a virtual folder for emails from his friend and co-worker Anna. He has another one for messages that have ximian.com in the address and <tt class="application">Ximian Evolution</tt> in the subject line, so he can keep a record of what people from work send him about <tt class="application">evolution</tt>. If Anna sends him a message about anything other than <tt class="application">Ximian Evolution</tt>, it only shows up in the "Anna" folder. When Anna sends him mail about the user interface for <tt class="application">evolution</tt>, he can see that message both in the "Anna" vFolder and in the "Internal Evolution Discussion" vFolder.</p>

          <br />

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Sender - The sender's address.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Recipients - The recipients of the message.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Subject - The subject line of the message.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Message Body - Search in the actual text of the message.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Expression - For programmers only: match a message according to an expression you write in the Scheme language, used to define vFolders in <tt class="application">Ximian Evolution</tt>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Date sent - Search messages according to the date on which they were sent: First, choose the conditions you want a message to meet -- <tt class="guilabel"><b>before</b></tt> a given time, <tt class="guilabel"><b>after</b></tt> it, and so forth. Then, choose the time. The vFolder will compare the message's time-stamp to the system clock when the filter is run, or to a specific time and date you choose from a calendar. You can even have it look for messages within a range of time relative to the filter -- perhaps you're looking for messages less than two days old.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Date Received - This works the same way as the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Date Sent</b></tt> option, except that it compares the time you got the message with the dates you specify.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Label - This works the same way as the <tt class="guilabel"><b>Score</b></tt> option, although it allows you to select from various labels applied to the message, such as <tt class="guilabel"><b>Important, Personal, To Do, Work</b></tt> or <tt class="guilabel"><b>Later</b></tt>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Score - Emails have a standard priority range from -3 (least important) to 3 (most important). You can have vFolders set the priority of messages you receive, and then have other vFolders applied only to those messages which have a certain priority.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Size (kb) - Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Status - Searches according to the status of a message, such as 'New'.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Attachments - Create a vFolder based on whether or not you have an attachment in the email.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Mailing List - Search based on the mailing list it came from.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Source Account - Search messages according the server you got them from. You can enter a URL or choose one from the drop-down list. This ability is only relevant if you use more than one mail source.</p>

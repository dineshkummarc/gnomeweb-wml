>&#13;	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a vFolder. vFolders, or virtual folders, are an advanced way
	of viewing your email messages within
	<TT
CLASS="application"
>Ximian Evolution</TT
>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, vFolders
	can help you stay on top of things.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	A vFolder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  In other words, while a conventional
	folder actually contains messages, a vFolder is a view of
	messages that may be in several different folders.  The
	messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of
	criteria you choose in advance.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	As messages that meet the vFolder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <TT
CLASS="application"
>Ximian Evolution</TT
> will
	automatically place them in and remove them from the
	vFolder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any vFolders which display it.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds
	of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and
	changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and
	students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less you
	can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  vFolders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.

>&#13;        If you use remote email storage like IMAP or Microsoft
        Exchange, and have created vFolders to search through them,
        the Unmatched vFolder will follow your lead, and search the
        remote folders as well. If you do not create any vFolders that
        search in remote mail stores, the Unmatched vFolder will not
        search in them either.

>&#13;	To organize his mailbox, Jim sets up a virtual folder for emails from
	his friend and co-worker Anna.  He has another one for messages that
	have ximian.com in the address and <TT
CLASS="application"
>Ximian Evolution</TT
> in the subject line, so he
	can keep a record of what people from work send him about
	<TT
CLASS="application"
>evolution</TT
>.  If Anna sends him a message about
	anything other than <TT
CLASS="application"
>Ximian Evolution</TT
>, it only shows up in the "Anna" folder.
	When Anna sends him mail about the user interface for
	<TT
CLASS="application"
>evolution</TT
>, he can see that message both in
	the "Anna" vFolder and in the "Internal Evolution Discussion"
	vFolder.

		    a given time, <TT

		    vFolders 
		    applied only to those messages which have a certain priority.

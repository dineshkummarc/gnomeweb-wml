>&#13;        Offline mode is a tool designed for use with IMAP or Exchange
        mail accounts in situations where you will not be connected to
        the network at all times. It will keep a local copy of one or
        more folders, and allow you to compose messages, storing them
        in your Outbox to be sent the next time you connect.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        While POP mail downloads all messages to your local system,
        IMAP and Exchange connections usually download just the
        headers, and fetch the rest only when you want to read the
        message.  Before you go offline, Evolution will download
        the unread messages from the folders you have chosen to
        store.

>Specifying Recipients for Email</H3

	   programs, recognizes three types of addressee: primary
	   recipients, secondary recipients, and hidden ("blind")
	   recipients.
         </P
><P
>&#13;            The simplest way to direct a message is to put the email
            address or addresses in the <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>To:</B
></TT
>
            field, which denotes primary recipients.  To send mail to
            more than one or two people, you can use the
            <TT
CLASS="guilabel"

>Cc:</B
></TT

><P
>&#13;            Hearkening back to the dark ages when people used
            typewriters and there were no copy machines, "Cc" stands
            for "Carbon Copy."  Use it whenever you want to share a
            message you've written to someone else.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>Bcc:</B

            use it like <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>Cc:</B
></TT
>, but people on the
            <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B
>Bcc:</B
></TT
> list are hidden from the other
            recipients of the message. Use it to send mail to large
            groups of people, especially if they don't know each other
            or if privacy is a concern.  If your <TT
CLASS="guilabel"
><B

          </P

>&#13;           If you frequently write email to the same groups of people,
           you can create address lists in the Contact Manager, and
           then send them mail as though they had a single address.
           To learn how to do that, read <A

>&#13;            Normally, you can't set text styles or insert pictures in
            emails, which is why email is often regarded as
            uncommunicative and cold, and why people often resort to
            using far too many exclamation points to convey their
            feelings.  However, most newer email programs can display
            images and text styles as well as basic alignment and
            paragraph formatting. They do this with <A

          you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a

          message you are forwarding.  Remember to note from whom the

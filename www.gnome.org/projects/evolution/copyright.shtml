license for your code (although we may also grant other licenses on
other terms). Second, we grant back to you as author all your
original rights to do what you want with your code, without any
fees or restrictions from us. This includes your right to relicense
under whatever terms you may desire.</p>

<h3>What Requires Assignment</h3>

<p>Very subtle or very difficult bug fixes of any number of lines
will always require copyright assignment. However, the following
types of changes do <em><u>not</u></em> require assignment:</p>
<span style=
"border:5px solid white; background:#dddddd; float:right;">Your
grant lets Ximian use your code, but you keep your original
ownership rights as well.</span>

  <li>Most changes under five lines.</li>

  <li>Translations.</li>

  <li>Typos and other "trivial" changes.</li>

  <li>Documentation.</li>

  <li>Artwork.</li>

  <li>A collection of simple one-line changes, even if the total
  number of lines changes is greater than five.</li>
</ul>

	Take control of your inbox!  With Evolution's junk filtering, you're free to read the
	email you want and not see much of the email you don't.  Bayesian-based junk filtering with optional remote rules get rid of all of the emails which bug you most.
	<!--<p><a href="images/screenshots/2.0/evo-junkprefs.png" alt="Screenshot of junk preferences"><img src="images/screenshots/2.0/thumb-evo-junkprefs.png"><br>Junk Preferences</a></p>-->
	<p>
	Junk filtering is easy, too.  You can either select "Mark as Junk" under the edit or context menu &mdash; or simply click the junk button on the toolbar.  
	</p>

	<h3>Search Folders (formerly called vFolders)</h3>
	<p>
	<a href="images/screenshots/2.0/evo-vfolder.png" class="img-inline"><img src="images/screenshots/2.0/thumb-evo-vfolder.png"></a>
	See your email the way you want it.  Search Folders are 
	saved intelligent searches which can display groups of email according to
	user-specified criteria.  Create Search Folders to combine mail from different mail accounts into a single view, quickly view
	all mail from your boss (or a particular friend :) &mdash; and new in 2.0, optional include entire threads in the
	results!
	</p>

	<h3>Integrated Security</h3>
	<p>
	<a href="images/screenshots/2.0/evo-security.png" class="img-inline-right"><img src="images/screenshots/2.0/thumb-evo-security.png"></a>
	Evolution includes support for signing and encrypting mail via GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) and S/MIME.  Encrypting mail
	helps you protect your privacy and helps those receiving your mail know its really from you.  Evolution 2.0 includes a
	handy interface to help you manage your GPG keys and S/MIME certificates as well as a place to manage keys and
	certificates which have been shared to you. 
	</p>

	<h3>Developer Platform (EDS)</h3>
	<p>
	<strong class="fixme">FIXME!</strong>
	<p>
	-->

	<h3>Desktop Integration</h3>

	<p>
	By using the evolution-data-server, other GNOME apps are integrating with Evolution including:
	<ul>
		<li>gnome-panel calendar applet lists your appointments and tasks</li>
		<li><a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> (formerly Gaim) patch to add buddies from Evolution contacts</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/planner/">Planner</a> - imports contacts and under development is a Planner backend that enables Evolution to show different planner files as lists of tasks</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Filters</h3>

	<p>
	Filters enable you to organize your mail as it arrives or on request.  Filters allow you to bundle, sort and
	distribute mail into various folders or otherwise process mail.  You can create multiple filters to perform multiple
	actins.  For example, your filters could put copies of one message into multiple folders, or keep one copy and send
	one to another person, and it can do that quickly.
	</p>

	<h3>Searching</h3>
	<p>
	Evolution automatically indexes messages so searching for that long lost email is faster and easier than many other
	mail clients.  
	</p>

	<h3>Web Calendars</h3>
	<p>
	You can add your favorite Web calendar so you can see upcoming football, movie or dvd releases, or a friend's schedule
	inside of Evolution.  One of the most popular sites for Web calendars is icalshare.com.
	</p>

	<h3>Collaboration Server support</h3>
	<p>
	Evolution includes support for Exchange 2000/2003 and GroupWise. You can configure Evolution to act as an Exchange
	client or a GroupWise client. Also there are also several projects underway to enable Evolution to support more
	collaboration servers including <a href="http://opengroupware.org/">OpenGroupware.org</a> - let us know and we'll add your project to this list!
	</p>

	<h3>Multiple Account Management</h3>
	<p>
	Account management tools let you receive, manage and organize messages from multiple email accounts or collaboration
	servers. Create new mail accounts easily with the Evolution account assistant. 
	</p>

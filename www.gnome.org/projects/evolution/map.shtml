<p><h1>Evolution Road Map</h1>

<p>This plan covers 3 versions after 2.0, coinciding with approximately 6 month releases cycles of GNOME, this is mostly core stuff and not absolute (for instance we'd put in other backends for opengroupware, exchange it, etc if they became available).  We want to list specific functional goals that are largish in nature.&nbsp; A lot of smaller features will just end up as EPlugins.</p>

The current development version is 2.1 and coincides with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.9/">GNOME 2.9</a>.

<H2>EPlugin</H2>

Interesting eplugin ideas have the "eplugin" keyword in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&email1=&emailtype1=substring&emailassigned_to1=1&email2=&emailtype2=substring&emailreporter2=1&changedin=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&short_desc=&short_desc_type=substring&long_desc=&long_desc_type=substring&bug_file_loc=&bug_file_loc_type=substring&keywords=eplugin&keywords_type=anywords&op_sys_details=&op_sys_details_type=substring&version_details=&version_details_type=substring&cmdtype=doit&namedcmd=Calendar+Bugs&newqueryname=&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&form_name=query">bugzilla</a>.

<H2>Other ideas</H2>

<UL>
    <LI>improving import/export (UI, error reporting, progress reporting) 
    <LI>doing future migration in EDS itself 
    <LI>long term future of etable/etree 
    <LI>C# wrappers for ECalBackend and EBookBackend to make rapid prototyping and testing easier 
    <LI>removing camel backend configuration from using a url to specify all configuration, since that isn't dynamic enough.&nbsp; Is kind of partially there with the persistent properties thing. 
    <LI>expand/fix the shell api's to make them useful for remote control/access to evolution.&nbsp; Actually a whole overhaul of the idl's wouldn't go astray, it isn't a huge task either.&nbsp; They're nasty and kind of useless outside of evolution right now (showURI is the only really usable method). 
    <LI>changing camel's store/folder apis to make them easier to implement.&nbsp; the ability to create a folder object without opening the folder and the like, would simplify all the nasty getfolderinfo and rename stuff. 
    <LI>using the plugin stuff to map things like backend configurators to the frontend 'loosely'.&nbsp; e.g. a custom camel provider might include the camel code, but also a plugin which the front-end will load *separately* to configure it, rather than the messy camelprovider tables which don't provide much flexibility.&nbsp; The same could happen w/ eds rather than using non-arbitrary property settings that the front-end needs to have specific info about. 
    <LI>have product design revisit the SMIME UI 
    <LI>auto email harvesting from incoming messages (for autocompletion) 
    <LI>expose saved searches as subfolders of contact folders (or add another root to the source tree: &quot;Saved Searches&quot; or &quot;Contact VFolders&quot; or whatever).&nbsp; It would be trivial to implement these entirely in the UI (you just &quot;(and &lt;saved-query&gt; &lt;ui-query&gt;)&quot; to do searches).&nbsp; If possible, add in ActiveDirectory's saved searches.

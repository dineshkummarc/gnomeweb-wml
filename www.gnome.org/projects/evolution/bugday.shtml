<h2>Bug Day Triaging</h2>

<p>Bug days take place on irc.gnome.org in #evolution from 1500 GMT to 0100 GMT (the next day).</p>

<p>If you decide to participate, we'll give you 10 (ten) nice bugs reports to work on; those reports may be be within one and maybe more of the following categories:</p>

<h3>Old Bugs</h3>

<p>Bugs that have been a long time in the database but aren't still fixed for any reason. You can check them in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/old-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/old-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x</a> (Please ask us about the current value of x)</p>

<h3>Probable Duplicates</h3>

<p>These bugs were triaged and added a keyword that simply put means &ldquo;I think I've seen this report before, but can't find it in bugzilla&rdquo;. In other words 'It's d&egrave;ja vu all over again'. Here, check in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/probabledups-needing-love.cgi">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/probabledups-needing-love.cgi</a><a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/old-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x">?num=x</a> "</p>

<h3>Wishlist</h3>

<p>Features requested by the community. Some of them can be essential for the perfect mailer, some others are requests suited for a handful of users, and some are plain crackpot: as one Evo developer said: 'I have one simple request.... and that is to have messages with freakin' laser beams attached to their headers.'</p>

<p>Triaging wishlist reports sometimes requires a lot more attention, since it's requirements' analysis. So phrasing, keywords and suggested actions are important.</p>

<p>These are in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/wishlist-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/wishlist-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x</a>.</p>

<h3>Crashers</h3>

<p>Reports arising from eventual crashes in Evolution. Sometimes they actually have been reproduced, but other times crashes were due to particular configurations, once-in-a-lifetime events. However, from time to time some problems were solved and someone simply forgot to close the report, or more than one problem was solved at once and the second report wasn't properly closed</p>

<p>Check for these in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/crash-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/crash-bugs-needing-love.cgi?num=x</a></p>

<h3>What to check for?</h3>

<p><strong>For all bugs:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Is it working now?</p>

    <p>This is a simple answer to a bug. 'It works for me / Now works'. Then report needs to be closed.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Are they already properly <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide">triaged</a> (Be aware that this triage page is specific for GNOME and some of the links point to GNOME Bugzilla while we are dealing with Ximian Bugzilla)</p>

    <p>This means that they have already been assigned at least</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A component (This means it isn't assigned to 'triage', but any of <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/describecomponents.cgi?product=Evolution">Evolution components</a></p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A target milestone (even if it's 'Future'). This means that it has been acknowledged as a software problem.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Is it a duplicate?</p>

    <p>Well, finding duplicates is not an easy task as it seems at first. We'll talk a little more when talking about probable dups.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Don't understand what is this report about...!</p>

    <p>No problem, simply let it alone :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, specific things to check about each group:</p>

<p><strong>Old Bugs:</strong></p>

<p>If it doesn't work and it's properly triaged, it must remain as it is.</p>

<p>BUT:</p>

<p>If target milestone is in the past (Anything that's not 1.4.x, Future, contrib or reschedule) then we have to update milestone. Please let us know!</p>

<p><strong>Probable duplicates.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Query the database with keywords from description, If the report has a <a href="bugs.shtml#backtrace">backtrace</a>, try to use the code near the crash point. Look for similar backtraces and the set of actions that led to the crash.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If there's no backtrace then try to search for the most descriptive words, as 'laser beams headers'</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Be careful, some descriptions are very much alike, but point to different problems.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If you find the perfect match, please let us know.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Crashers</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Try to reproduce it</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>If you can reproduce it, the report should stay. Check then if it's a duplicate.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Wishlist</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Basically, check if the requested enhancement is there now. If it's there, then we must close it.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Check if it is a duplicates</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So basically that all. Have fun!</p>

<h2>Evolution 1.1.1 Release Notes</h2>

<p>
Ximian is proud to announce the first in a short series of beta
releases leading up to the Evolution 1.2 release. Evolution 1.2 will
have a number of exciting new features and improvements over the 1.0
release. This release, Evolution 1.1.1, will demonstrate these
features and serve as a stress-test before we declare the final 1.2
release ready for launch.
</p>

<p>
The release is available for these distributions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>       Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3 for x86 
 <li>      Solaris 8 for UltraSPARC

      <li> Linux Mandrake 8.1 and 8.2 for x86 
      <li> SuSE 7.3 and 8.0 for x86 
      <li> Yellow Dog Linux 2.2
      <li> Red Hat Linux 6.2
</ul>

<p>
Note: On SuSE 8.0, gnome-spell is not available for this release.
</p>

<h3>Upgrading: Process and Caveats</h3>

<p></p>
<h4>Warning</h4>

<p>
Evolution 1.1.1 is a BETA release.  This means that it has bugs,
including possibly destructive bugs that can cause valuable data to be
lost.
</p>

<p>
Please make sure you back up your mail, calendar, and addressbook
information before using Evolution 1.1.1.  In particular, you are
strongly advised to backup the `evolution' directory in your home
directory if you are upgrading from a 1.0.x version of Evolution to
Evolution 1.1.1.
</p>

<p>
If you encounter problems, please <a
href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Evolution">file
a bug in our tracking system</a> or use the <tt>bug-buddy</tt> problem
reporter. We will do our best to fix any issues that you uncover.
</p>

<h4>Upgrading From 1.0.x</h4>

<p>
The format of certain configuration files has changed in this version
of Evolution.  When you start Evolution 1.1.1 for the first time, it
will automatically migrate your configuration so that it will work as
expected with this version.
</p>


<h4>Returning to 1.0.x</h4>

<p>
If you want to return to a 1.0.x version after trying 1.1.1, you have
to restore the original configuration files.  From the command-line,
you can do the following, after having quit Evolution:
</p>
{include file="common/xterm.tpl" text="
        killev<br>
        cd ~/evolution<br>
        mv filters.xml.bak-1.0 filters.xml<br>
        mv vfolders.xml.bak-1.0 vfolders.xml<br>
        mv shortcuts.xml.bak-1.0 shortcuts.xml<br>
        mv mail/imap.bak-1.0 mail/imap<br>
"}

<p>
Note that any changes to filters, vFolders or shortcuts made with
1.1.1 will be lost after this operation.
</p>
<p>
Also note that the upgrade mechanism runs automatically only the first
time you run 1.1.1.  For this reason, if you run Evolution 1.1.1, then
go back to 1.0 using the aforementioned procedure, and then go back to
using 1.1.1 again, the settings will not be upgraded.
</p>

<p>
To force the upgrade to happen again in this case, use the following
command to start Evolution 1.1.1:
</p>

       
{include file="common/xterm.tpl" text="evolution --force-upgrade"}

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you are using Ximian Connector 1.0.x, it will be
uninstalled by Ximian Evolution 1.2 Beta 1 if you install using Red
Carpet. If you install Evolution without using Red Carpet, please remove
Ximian Connector 1.0.x before installing Evolution Evolution 1.2 Beta 1.
You cannot use Connector 1.0.x with Evolution 1.2 Beta. If you would
like to help test the next release of Ximian Connector, please contact
your Ximian sales representative.
</p>



{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="Significant Changes" class="h3"}
<p></p>
{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="Search Criteria Changes" class="h4"}

<p>
When you specify multiple words in search "contains" criterion,
Evolution will now search the mail messages that contain all the words
specified, in any order.  (The 1.0.x behavior was to look for the
whole string in "subject contains" matches, and matched no messages in
the case of body searches.)
</p>
<p>
This applies to the search bar, the filter rules and the vFolder
rules.  Filter rules and vFolder rules might need to be re-adjusted
after you upgrade to version 1.1.1.
</p>

{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="IMAP Folder Name Changes (I18N)" class="h4"}

<p>
If you created any folder names using non-ASCII characters using prior
versions of Evolution, you will find they may not be displayed
properly anymore.  This is because previous versions did not implement
IMAP I18N folder names correctly as specified in RFC 2060.
</p>
<p>
The upgrade script will try to rectify any filters or vFolders using
any such names.  However, as it does not know the character set used
by the server, non ISO-8859-1 (latin-1) characters will not be
properly converted.  You may need to verify the filter and vFolder
rules in this case.
</p>
<p>
Also note that if such folder names do not display properly that it is
purely cosmetic and may be fixed by renaming the folder(s) in
question.
</p>

{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="Key Binding Changes" class="h4"}
<p>
Unmodified letter keys will now move to the next message whose sender
or subject (depending on your sort order) begins with that letter. The
previous key bindings that depended upon unmodified key-strokes have
changed. Use the , and .  or [ and ] for previous and next unread
message, and the ` (backtick) to toggle the message pane. Shortcuts
using control keys are not affected.
</p>


{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="Known Bugs" class="h4"}
<p>
<b>Unnamed Contact Lists:</b> If you have any unnamed contact lists in
any of your addressbook folders, you might experience hangs and/or
crashes when specifying destination addresses, for example when
composing meeting requests.  Giving a name to all the contact lists
will fix the problem. 
</p>


<p><b>Pilot Conduits:</b> Not yet available</p>

<p>
<b>Solaris/CDE Application Group:</b> This release of Evolution
doesn't install icons in the CDE "Application" group as Evolution
1.0.x used to do.  While this doesn't affect users who are running
Ximian Desktop, users who wish to run Evolution under the CDE
environment will also have to set the PATH, GNOME_PATH and
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables to point to the Evolution
installation before launching the `evolution' executable.
</p>

<p>
This can be done with a shell script like this <a href="..olution-nognome.tar">example</a>.</p>

{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="New Features" class="h3"}
<p></p>
{include file="common/headlinebar.tpl" text="General" class="h4"}

    <li> You can now specify your default mail, calendar, tasks and
      contacts folders.  The shortcuts in the shortcut bar will always
      point to the default folder; so for example if you have an IMAP

      default and clicking on the Inbox icon on the shortcut bar will
      take you to the INBOX on the IMAP account.

    <li> Fonts for displaying of HTML mail can now be configured from
      within Evolution (instead of having to use GNOME Control
      Center).

      message when new mail arrives.  It is also possible to trigger
      these actions based on a filter rule.

      been integrated better with the menu bar and the rest of the

<ul>
    <li> Loading speed has been improved.

      incorporation, faster mail display, and faster searches.
      Overall, the new engine should work much better for larger
      folders, and take considerably less space on the disk.

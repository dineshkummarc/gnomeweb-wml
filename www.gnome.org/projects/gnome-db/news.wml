                    GNOME-DB 0.1.0 has been released! This release marks
                    the maturity of GNOME-DB, and as part of this, the
                    separation of the libgda part (the data-access framework)
                    from the GNOME-specific stuff. Read the

                    Akira TAGOH, one of the GNOME-DB developers, has put
                    the (preliminary) GNOME-DB Debian packages for you
                    to have a try at how things are going. For this, you
                    just need to add the following lines to your
                    <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:

	deb http://www.gnome.gr.jp/~tagoh/debian/gnome-db ./
	deb-src http://www.gnome.gr.jp/~tagoh/debian/gnome-db ./

                    GNOME-DB CVS has been split into 2 different modules.
                    One is <code>libgda</code>, which contains all the
                    database access part and which is going to be 
                    GNOME-independent. The other one is gnome-db2, which
                    is the GNOME specific part.

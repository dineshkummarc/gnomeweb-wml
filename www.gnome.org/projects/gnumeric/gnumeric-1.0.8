	Really fix import this time.
	* Don't crash on xls import if locale is confused.
	YAY!! I was finally able to replicate this.  We were not handling
	setlocale returning NULL when a user was using a bogus locale.

	* COUNT should only count ints and floats not bools

	* Add Drachma to EURO (If you use our code please _report_ errors)

	* Support implicit conversion from string -> number in scalar graphs.

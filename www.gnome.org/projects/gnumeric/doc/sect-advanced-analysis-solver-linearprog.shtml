    linear functions.  As you probably already know, a linear function
    is the one whose graph is always a straight line.  Thus each
    variable of it appears in a separate term with its coefficient.
    There must be no products or quotients of these variables.  In
    addition, the exponent of each term must be one.  No logarithmic,
    exponential, trigonometric terms are allowed.  Especially note that
    functions like ABS, IF, MAX, and MIN are not linear.  Here are a
    few examples of linear functions:</p><div xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="programlisting block-indent"><pre class="programlisting">    3x + y - 5z
    -3.23x + 0.33y
    -0.3x + 4y - 2z + 1.2m
    </pre></div><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">The linear problem has a so called objective function which
    is to be minimized or maximized and constraints.  The objective
    function is the one whose value we would like to optimize.
    Typically, this function could determine the profit generated by
    the expected sales of the given model (maximization problem), or,
    the cost of the production in the given environment (minimization
    problem).  Anyway, on purely mathematical point of view, we could
    examine the following objective function:</p><div xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="programlisting block-indent"><pre class="programlisting">    Maximize 2x + 3y - z
    </pre></div><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">In linear programming the variables of this functions are
    not allowed to take any values (otherwise the maximum of any
    objective function would be infinity).  The problem also has
    constraints.  The constraints are a set of linear functions and a
    set of their right hand side values (RHS).  For example, for the
    previously defined objective function we have the following
    constraints:</p><div xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="programlisting block-indent"><pre class="programlisting">    x + y &lt;= 5           (#1)
    3x - y + z &lt;= 9      (#2)
    x + y &gt;= 1           (#3)
    x + y + z = 4        (#4)
    x, y, z &gt;= 0         (non-negativity assumption)
    </pre></div><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">This constraint set consists of three inequality constraints
    (#1-#3) and one equality constraint (#4).  Their RHS values are 5,
    9, 1, and 4.  In addition, we also have the non-negativity
    assumption.  That is, all the variables (x, y, and z) have to take
    only positive numbers.  The idea is to find the optimal values for
    the variables (x, y, and z) but also to satisfy all the given
    constraints.</p></div></div><div class="navbar"><div class="navbar-prev"><span class="navbar-prev"><a class="navbar navbar-prev" href="sect-advanced-analysis-solver.shtml" title="Solver">Solver</a></span></div><div class="navbar-next"><span class="navbar-next"><a class="navbar navbar-next" href="sect-advanced-analysis-solver-modeling.shtml" title="Spreadsheet Modeling">Spreadsheet Modeling</a></span></div></div></body></html>

> This section of the manual describes the use of the
	menubar and the menus themselves. The rest of <A

>Chapter 3</A
> then explains each entry in every
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> menu, submenu or context
	menu.</P
><P
>A menu is a graphical element within a program which appears
	with a list of options. For instance, almost all applications have a
	<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
> menu through which the user can access the
	computer's filesystem to open or save their work. The main menus are 
	on the menubar. The use of these menus is discussed in <A
HREF="menus.html#MENU-BARS"
>Section 3.1.1</A
>.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
>
	also uses context menus to give users a quick way to access certain
	commands. The context menu will open up right under the mouse
	pointer when one of the mouse buttons, usually the rightmost, is
	clicked. This menu is called a context menu because the entries in
	the menu are different depending on the location of the mouse
	pointer. The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>context</SPAN
> menus are discussed in <A
HREF="context-menu.html"
>Section 3.10</A
>.</P
><P
>Both the main menus, on the menubar, and context menus may have
	sub-menus. Sub-menus are indicated by a small right pointing arrow. To
	access the sub-menus, the user must move the pointer down to the sub-menu
	entry and carefully across to the position of the little arrow. After an
	instant the sub-menu will open up and the user must carefully move the
	pointer directly across into the sub-menu. Occasionally, when there is not
	enough room to the right of the currently open menu, sub-menus may open to
	the left. Navigating sub-menus can be difficult since the menu will close
	if the mouse pointer moves into any other menu entry.</P
><P
>	Menu entries which are followed by an ellipsis (three dots) indicate that
	this entry will open a dialog window which will ask the user for more choices.

	be placed in different parts of the
	<SPAN

><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> menus are opened
	with a simple click on the name of the menu in the menu
	bar. Once clicked, the menu will stay open. If the mouse
	pointer is dragged over the name of another menu on the
	menubar, the first menu will close and the new menu open
	up. This is a useful way to look in each menu to hunt for a
	commands. Menus can also be opened through the keyboard. One
	of the letters in each menu is underlined. Typing the
	<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Alt</B
> key at the same time as the underlined
	letter key will open the menu. This is also true of
	sub-menus. Once the menus are open, the arrow keys can be used
	to move between menus or select an entry in a particular
	menu. An open menu can be closed with a click over any other
	area of the application or of the desktop. The menus can also
	be closed by typing the escape key,

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> menus, like
                most menus in GNOME project software, are "tear-off"
                menus. This means that the menu can be opened up into
                its own window and kept open in a differnt part of the
                screen. This is useful if there is a menu that you
                keep using for a particular task. Just beneath the top
                of each menu is a dashed line. Clicking on that line
                tears off the menu.</P

>To get rid of a dettached menu, the dotted line can be clicked
	once more or the window containing the menu can simply be
	closed. The window can usually be closed by clicking in the top
	right corner of the window. Like the window containing <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
>, this outer
	window is not actually made by <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
>. Therefore the manner in which a
	user closes this window will depend on the configuration of the desktop the
	user has chosen.</P

> Many menu entries are followed by a series of keynames. These keys
		can be used to perform the menu action without having to open the menu.
		These are often combinations of keys involving the control key which is
		labeled as <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl</B
>, the shift key which is labeled <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Shift</B
> and the function
		keys which are labeled with an <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>F</B
> and then a number. For example, to
		quickly cut a selection (accessible through the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>Edit</SPAN
>
		menu), the user can make a selection and then type the
		control key and the "x" key at the same time.

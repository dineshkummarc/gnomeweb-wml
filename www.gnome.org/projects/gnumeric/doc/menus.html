> This section of the manual describes the use of the menu bar and the
	menus themselves. The manual then explains each entry in every Gnumeric menu, 
	submenu or context menu.</P
><P
>A menu is a graphical element within a program which appears with a list of
	options. For instance, almost all applications have a <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>File</SPAN
> menu
	through which the user can access the computer's filesystem. The main menus
	are on the menubar. The use of these menus is discussed in <A
HREF="menus.html#MENU-BARS"
>Section 3.1.1</A
>. 
	Gnumeric also uses a context menu as a quick way to access certain
	commands. The context menu will open up right under the mouse pointer when
	one of the mouse buttons, usually the rightmost, is clicked. This menu is
	called a context menu because the entries in the menu are different
	depending on the location of the mouse pointer. The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>context</SPAN
> 
	menu is discussed in <A
HREF="context-menu.html"
>Section 3.10</A
>.</P

      The menus provide quick and organized access to all major commands such as

>The leftmost portion of the menu bar is a little tab. This tab can be used
	to grab the menu bar and remove it from the rest of the application. This is
	done by clicking and holding on the tab and dragging it away from the Gnumeric
	window. The menu can also be placed in different parts of the Gnumeric window,
	so that it could appear at the very bottom of Gnumeric as is shown in <A

	of the Gnumeric window, the standard toolbar has been detached and the object
	toolbar has been moved the the right side. The user can choose what
	configuration works best. The toolbars can be dragged back into place in the same 
	manner by which they were moved originally.</P

>Gnumeric menus are opened with a simple click on the name of the menu in the menu bar. Once clicked, the menu will stay open. If the mouse pointer is dragged over the name of another menu on the menubar, the first menu will close and the new menu open up. This is a useful way to look in each menu to hunt for a commands. The open menu can be closed with a click over any other area of the application or of the desktop. The menus can also be closed by typing the escape key, <SPAN
CLASS="KEYSYM"
>Esc</SPAN
>.</P

><P
>Gnumeric menus, like most menus in GNOME project software, are "tear-off" menus. This means that the menu can be opened up into its own window and kept open in a differnt part of the screen. This is useful if there is a menu that you keep using for a particular task. Just beneath the top of each menu is a broken line. Clicking on that line, tears off the menu.</P

>To get rid of a dettached menu, the dotted line can be clicked once more or
the window containing the menu can simply be
closed. The window can usually be closed by clicking in the top right corner of the window
but that might be different depending on the desktop in which you have Gnumeric
running.</P

    This manual is the most complete source of explanation for
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> and attempts to describe as
    much of the program as possible. However, this manual cannot
    answer all the possible questions readers may have: the manual is
    not yet finished and there are many situations which cannot be
    explained through a manual. Other sources of information which
    might be helpful to <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> users are
    presented below.

    <p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      Several of the sources of information below involve talking
      directly with the people who have created
      <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span>. These people are volunteers
      who have spend several years working on the program to make it
      useful. They will all be glad to help you
      <span class="emphasis" style="font-style: italic; ">but</span> only if they decide they want to. They
      are all busy and only volunteer on this project. You can take
      several steps to make these people want to help you.

    <p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      First of all, try to help yourself by reading the existing
      documents. If you have read the documents, others will be much
      more likely to want to answer any questions that
      remain. Secondly, be polite by introducing yourself, thanking
      developers for their hard work and asking your questions
      nicely. Please be aware that the developers all respect each
      other and their users so therefore, while their answers may
      appear brisk or discourteous, they are simply trying to be
      efficient and save time by being curt. Please assume they
      respect you and want to help you, after all they have written a
      program for you to use.

                First, please look carefully through this manual to
                see if you can answer your own question. This can be

                Second, look at the

                the world wide web for explanations using other

                Another useful source of help is the literature
                written for other

                quite similar to a number of other spreadsheets and

	  significant amounts of testing with a diverse group of
	  users.  There is also a large set of test workbooks to

>File compatibility</SPAN
> &mdash;
	  Transparent access and manipulation of files from other applications
	  is vital in a modern office.  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> can
	  read files from several well known proprietary and free spreadsheets
	  including MS Excel (tm), Lotus 1-2-3 (tm), Applix (tm), Psion, Sylk,
	  XBase Oleo, and HTML.  It can also export to MS Excel (tm) along with
	  several open formats such as LaTeX \longtables, HTML, roff.  Rounding
	  out the i/o routines is a highly configurable text importer/exporter
	  to ensure that data can be transfered smoothly.  New formats can
	  easily be added in a modular fashion via a plug-in.

	  familiarity with other applications will still apply.

>Sufficient feature set</SPAN
> &mdash;
	  While people may quote the statistic that most users only need 20% of
	  the features in some products that is not entirely true.  Most need a
	  common 10% and then some non-overlapping collection for the other 10%.
	  Implementing enough of the features to support day to day use by the
	  average spreadsheet user has taken time.  However, just having the
	  feature listed as a bullet point does little for a user.
	  <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> has attempted to only provide
	  full implementations of the features it offers, preferring to leave a
	  feature out, rather than provide something that is only useful in a
	  screen-shot.

	to ensure that it can comfortably scale to moderately large loads (1M
	cells) while remaining usable on older hardware.  The availability of
	clean reasonably documented source makes it simple to do things like
	change the maximum size of a sheet.

><P
>      The best way to learn how to use
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> is to begin exploring the
      program yourself. Enter some data into cells by clicking on the
      cell, typing a number and hitting
      return. <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
>  supports
      different kinds of data such as numbers, dates, currency and
      text by formating each kind of data differently and by
      calculating results appropriate to each data type. To learn more
      look at <A
HREF="editing.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>.
    </P
><P
>      Write a formula by clicking on an empty cell, typing the equals key,
      clicking on a second cell that has a number, typing the minus key, typing
      2 and hitting return. The number you see should be the number in the
      second cell minus two. Try changing the number in the second cell and
      watch <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> automatically re-calculate the
      result. For more powerful functions see <A
HREF="formulas.html"
>Section 6.2</A
> later in this manual.
    </P
><P
>      You can format the data, by changing the text color, adding borders and
      changing the placement. Explore the bottom toolbar and the menu that
      opens when you click on a cell with the rightmost mouse button. Look at 
      <A

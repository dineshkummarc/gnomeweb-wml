>Gnumeric is a powerful spreadsheet program created by the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>GNOME</A
> project. Gnumeric provides GNOME users 
	with a core application for their desktops.</P
><P
>This manual describes Gnumeric version 1.0. This manual is intended
	for new readers and advanced readers alike. This chapter gives a quick
	introduction to Gnumeric.  </P
><P
>Gnumeric can be compared to other free and commercial spreadsheets programs 
	based on these features:

>			<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Compatibility</SPAN
> &mdash;Gnumeric aims to replicate all 
			the functionality of Excel and other spreadsheets. Gnumeric currently 
			provides the core capabilities expected of a spreadsheet. For instance, 
			Gnumeric has almost all of the calculation functions available in Excel 
			and a few advanced ones of its own. 
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>			<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>File formats support</SPAN
> &mdash; Gnumeric can use Excel, 
			lotus 1-2-3, Applix, Sylk, XBase and Oleo file formats. Gnumeric
			can also export its tables to LaTeX \longtables. Gnumeric can
			easily be customized to support new formats.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>			<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Graphs</SPAN
> &mdash; Gnumeric uses another GNOME program 
			called Guppi to draw its graphs. Guppi is a powerful display engine for 
			data which allows gnumeric users to redisplay their data directly on 
			screen as they iteract with it.
			</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>			<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Internationalization</SPAN
> &mdash; Gnumeric works in
			many different languages. It is already being used by people around the
			globe in their native languages. The language capabilites of
			Gnumeric are set to improve dramatically in the next year to enable
			support for languages written left-right.</P

>Free Software</SPAN

HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"
TARGET="_top"
>free software</A
> 
			released under the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"
TARGET="_top"
>GNU GPL</A
>. It is a
			young project but developing fast based on the free software nature of
			development. As an added bonus, it does not inherently cost its users 
			any money.

>1.1.1. What is a spreadsheet?</A
></H2
><P
>A spreadsheet is an application to analyze and manage numeric data. It can 
	calculate numbers based on others using sophisticated formuals. For example, 
	Gnumeric can perform most basic statistical analyses. A spreadsheet can also plot 
	data and print out tables of results. Spreadsheets are used to access databases, 
	find results and perform calculations on these results. A spreadsheet can be used 
	to maintain budget data, time allocations, personal finances, membership lists and 
	many tasks which involve the storage, processing and reporting of number based 
	data sets.</P

>1.1.2. Getting started using Gnumeric.</A
></H2
><P
>The best way to learn how to use Gnumeric is to begin exploring the program 
	yourself. Enter some data into cells by clicking on the cell, typing a number and 
	hitting return. Gnumeric supports different kinds of data such as numbers, dates, 
	currency and text by formating each kind of data differently and by calculating 
	results appropriate to each data type. To learn more look at the manual section on 
	data entry <A
HREF="editing.html"
>Chapter 6</A
>.</P
><P
> Write a formula by clicking on an empty cell, typing the equals key, clicking 
	on a second cell that has a number, typing the minus key, typing 2 and hitting 
	return. The number you see should be the number in the second cell minus two. Try 
	changing the number in the second cell and watch gnumeric automatically re-calculate 
	the result. For more powerful functions see the section on formulas 
	<A
HREF="formulas.html"
>Section 6.2</A
> later in this manual. </P
><P
>You can format the data, by changing the text colour, adding borders and 
	changing the placement. Explore the bottom toolbar and the menu that opens when 
	you click on a cell with the rightmost mouse button. Look at 
	<A
HREF="formatting.html"
>Chapter 9</A
> later in this manual. </P

>If you would like to learn more about Gnumeric, read this manual, visit the 
	<A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/"
TARGET="_top"
> Gnumeric 
	home page</A
>, ask friends who use spreadsheets or read a book on how to use 
	Excel, since Gnumeric behaves almost exactly like Excel. If you have questions 
	you can also send them to the Gnumeric mailing list at </P

	by default.  The current selection is indicated by a
	rectangular box with a little box on the lower right, this
	case cell J12. The view in this figure shows the middle
	portion of a worksheet which is evident in two ways. Firstly,
	the column and row headers do not start at column A and row
	1. Secondly, the scroll thumbs are not at the top and
	left. The thumbs are the boxes within the scroll bars that are
	used to scroll. Note also that cell D19 has a comment within
	it which is shown by the little red triangle at the top right
	corner.</p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">The size of a cell is determined by the width of the
	column and height of the row that the cell is in. The columns
	and rows can be resized by acting on the header relevant to
	the cell. The user must move the mouse pointer to the edge of
	the header which is either to the right or below the cell.
	With the mouse pointer in this position, the pointer will
	change to a set of opposite pointing arrows. The user must
	then drag this edge away from the top left corner. This takes
	a little practice.</p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">The cell area is the core of Gnumeric. Therefore the

    Rows are labeled along the left side of the worksheet. Each label

      The cell grid area's scrollbars work like other scrollbars. In
      this case they let the user work on a worksheet which is much
      bigger than what could be shown at any given moment.

      At the bottom of <a class="xref" href="cell-grid.shtml#cell-grid.png" title="The Cell Grid area, with cells of different sizes.">Figure 4-22</a>, Gnumeric has
      a tabbed sheet indicator. This is the boxes with the labels
      "Guppies", "Turtles", "Mermaids", "seahorses" and so on. In
      workbooks where there are more than one sheet, extra tabs are
      used to indicate how many sheets are there, and also allows the
      user to move to another sheet by clicking the proper tab. Each
      tab is a link to a separate worksheet within Gnumeric. In this
      figure, the "Turtles" tab has been selected. Gnumeric shows this
      by making the "Turtles" since the tab is a little bigger and
      making it overlap the two neighbouring tabs.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      On the far right, the two arrows indicate that there are more
      sheets in the workbook and more tabs for those
      sheets. Unfortunately, there is not enough space to show them
      all so Gnumeric displays these arrows. If all the sheets are
      visible, these arrows will not be displayed. These arrows can be
      used to scroll the tabs and bring tabs that were hidden into
      view. This may be a little difficult to understand and work with
      but becomes easier quickly.

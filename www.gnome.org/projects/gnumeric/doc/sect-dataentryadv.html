    This section describes advanced methods for data entry in
    <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>. This includes techniques
    useful when adding large amounts of data, methods to automatically
    catch mistakes during data entry, using pre-defined templates to
    format data input, obtaining data from external sources and
    generating sequences of random numbers with defined distributions.
  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sect-dataentryadv-large"></a>5.4.1. Entering Large Quantities of Data</h3></div></div><p>
      It is sometimes necessary to enter large amounts of data by hand
      into a spreadsheet. To facilitate this work,
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> provides several techniques
      to facilitate the entry of large amounts of data.
    </p><p>
      If data are to be entered into a series of rows or columns, this
      region can be selected ahead of time thereby modifying the
      behaviour of the data entry keys (the Enter,
      Tab and arrow keys).
    </p><div class="procedure"><p><b>Data entry into a region</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
            Select the region with the mouse. For example, the region
            from cell C4 to cell E8 can be selected by clicking with
            the left mouse button on cell C4 and dragging the mouse
            cursor to cell E8. (More information on complex selections
            is presented below.)
          </p></li><li><p>
            Enter data by typing the data and the the
            Enter key. If this is done repeatedly,
            the fifth time the Enter key is pressed,
            the selection will not move to cell C9 but will jump up to
            cell D4.
          </p></li></ol></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">
        The Tab key can also be used instead of the
        Enter key to move sequentially through the
        selection.
      </p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sect-dataentryadv-series"></a>5.4.2. Entering a Regular Sequence</h3></div></div><p>
          It is often necessary to enter a regular sequence of numbers
          or a repeated sequence of
          text. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> provides several
          ways to input series and sequences of this kind.
        </p><p>
          The simplest way to fill a series with the same element
          repeated involves entering the element once and dragging the
          selection box to fill that element repeatedly. For example,
          the text "employee:" could be input into cell C2. That cell
          could then be selected. The selection box is a thick white
          rectangle which surrounds the cell. This selection box has a
          small white square at the bottom right hand corner. If the
          mouse cursor is placed above this square box, it changes to
          a thin cross. If the left hand mouse button is clicked and
          held, and the mouse dragged to cell C10,
          <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will automatically fill
          all of the cells with the identical string.
        </p><p>
          An alternative way to enter data into a region involves
          first selecting the region, then typing the value and
          finally typing the
          Ctrl+Enter
          key combination. This will fill the whole region with the
          identical value which was originally entered.
        </p><p>
          A similar method is available to fill sequences of
          integers. If the example just given was altered so that cell
          C2 had the number 14 and the Ctrl key was
          held during the dragging of the selection,
          <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will automatically fill
          the cells C2 to C10 with the series 14,15,16,...,22.
        </p><p>
          More complex series and sequences of data can be entered
          with a similar mechanism. 
        </p><p>
          To do an autofill:
        </p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	    Enter a value into the first cell you wish to
	    autofill. For example, the cell C2 could have the number
	    "24" entered.
	  </p></li><li><p>
	    Enter a second value into the second cell you wish to
	    autofill. This must be adjacent to the first cell. This
	    sets the increment to use when autofilling the rest of
	    your cells. For example, the cell D2 could have the number
	    "28" entered.
	  </p></li><li><p>
	    Select both the cells just entered. At the bottom-right of
	    the selection should be a small box. Your mouse cursor
	    will change to a cross-hair when placed over the box.
	    Press and hold on the box. Drag in the direction, either
	    vertical or horizonatal, you wish to increment and release
	    when all the cells are filled. For example, selecting
	    cells C2 and D2, then dragging the bottom right of the
	    selection to cell I2 will fill the cells with the sequence
	    from 24 to 48 with each increment being 4.
	  </p></li></ol></div><p>
          An alternative to the last step involves using the
          menus. Once the first two values have been input, the whole
          range to be filled can be selected using the mouse and then
          the <b>Autofill</b> selection can be
          made from the <b>Edit</b> and
          <b>Fill</b>. This will automatically
          complete the series in the selected region.
        </p><p>
	  <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> is able to increment
	  several types of data beyond simple integers. The proceedure
	  is the same as described above but involves different
	  starting values. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> can
	  increment:
	<div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><b>Integers</b></dt><dd><p>
		1, 2, 3, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Natural Numbers</b></dt><dd><p>
		1.03, 2.05, 3.07, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Weekday Names</b></dt><dd><p>
		Monday, Tuesday, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Weekday Abbreviations</b></dt><dd><p>
		Mon, Tues, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Month Names</b></dt><dd><p>
		January, February, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Month Abbreviations</b></dt><dd><p>
		Jan, Feb, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Strings with Numbers</b></dt><dd><p>
		Item1, Item2, etc
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Dates</b></dt><dd><p>
		11/14/2001, 11/15/2001, etc.
	      </p><p>
		<b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> supports
		incrementing the date by month, date, or year.
	      </p><p>
		  Note that, While <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>
		  will increment days of the month, if you do
		  11/14/2001 and 12/14/2001, it will recognize it as
		  the same day of the month and increment the month so
		  the next value would be to 1/14/2002 instead of the
		  day difference.
		</p></dd></dl></div>
        </p><p>
          <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> can be explicitly told
          the cells to autofill as in the examples above, but it can
          also guess the number of cells to fill based on the length
          of an adjacent column or row. For example, if the cells B2
          to B10 have information and cell C2 has the integer value
          "1", then selecting cell C2 and double clicking on the
          bottom rightmost box of the selection rectangle will fill
          the value "1" from cell C3 to cell C10.

      The entry of large amounts of data into a spreadsheet is tedious
      work which is prone to repeated
      mistakes. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> provides a tool to
      automatically correct commonly made simple mistakes. The
      corrections are configured and activated using AutoCorrect
      Dialog, available via <b>Auto Correct</b> in
      the <b>Tools</b> menu.
    </p><div class="figure"><p><a name="fig-autocorrect-figure"></a><b>Figure 5.3.

Correct TWo INitial CApitals</h4></div></div><p>A common mistake is to hold down the shift key a little bit
     too long while typing initial letters.  When it happens, you will
     get two initial capitals instead of one.  If this correction rule
     is activated, the second letter of words beginning with two
     capital letters is automatically lowercased.  For example, if you
     type `TOtal' into a cell it is replaced by `Total'.  Note that if
     the word contains two capital letters only, it is not
     replaced.</p><p>It is possible to specify exceptions to this tool.  For
     example, you do not want the tool to replace the word `PVbonds'
     when it is typed.  To specify exceptions, press the
     ``Exceptions...''  button in the dialog.  This should pop up the
     ``Auto correct exceptions'' dialog.  In this dialog, select the
     ``INitial CApitals'' page.  In this page, type `PVbonds' into the
     ``Do not correct'' entry, and press ``Add'' button.  Now the word
     should be included in the list of exceptions.  To remove a word
     from the list, select the word and press the ``Remove'' button.
     If you now press ``Ok'' the exceptions in the list are
     activated.</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect-dataentryadv-autocorrect-first-letter"></a>5.4.3.2. Capitalize the First Letter of Sentences</h4></div></div><p>If this correction rule is activated, the first letter of a

     ``Auto correct exceptions'' dialog.  In this dialog, select the
     ``First letter'' page.  In this page, type `i.g.' into the ``Do
     not capitalize after'' entry, and press ``Add'' button.  Now the
     word should be included in the list of exceptions.  To remove a
     word from the list, select the word and press the ``Remove''

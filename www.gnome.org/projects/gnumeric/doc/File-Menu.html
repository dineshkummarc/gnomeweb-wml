The File Menu</h2></div></div><p>The <b>File</b> menu is the most important
	menu in <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> because it gives
	the user the ability to interact with the computer operating
	system. This menu allows the user to create files containing
	all the work they have done. It also enables users to print
	the results of their work. Finally, the
	<b>File</b> menu is the best way to close
	<b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>.</p><div class="figure"><p><a name="menu-file-labelled.png"></a><b>Figure 4.5.

     	       <b>New</b> --- Create a new workbook. This 
				opens a new workbook in a new window. By default the workbook
				will be named &quot;Book1&quot; or another number if there is already a
				worksheet with that name open. Note that the opened file has
				not yet been saved.
     	      </p></li><li><p>
     	     <b>Open...</b> --- The 
				<b>Open</b> menu item opens the file chooser
				dialog to allow the user to pick an existing workbook for 
				Gnumeric to open. Only two file types can be opened with this 
				option. The <b>Open</b> menu item can open 
				Gnumeric's default XML 
			based file format which uses the extension &quot;.gnumeric&quot; and can 
			open Microsoft Excel's file format which uses the &quot;.xls&quot; extension. 
			The <b>Open</b> menu item creates a new window 
			containing the selected file.  A more extensive dicsussion is
			presented in <a href="sect-files-opening-importing.html#opening" title="9.2.1. Opening Files">Opening Files</a>.
      	   </p></li><li><p>
      		    <b>Import...</b> --- The 
					<b>Import...</b> menu item opens a file
					chooser dialog similar to the one opened by the 
					<b>Open</b> menu item. The
					<b>Import...</b> dialog has a file type
					selector in which the user can pick supported file
					formats. For more information on file import, including the
					extensive druid to assist users importing text files, such 
					as tab delimited files or comma separated value files, 
					see <a href="sect-files-opening-importing.html#importing" title="9.2.2. Importing Files">Importing Files</a>.

          <b>Save</b> --- The
		     <b>Save</b> menu item saves the current
         	 worksheet. If the file has been named and saved before, this will
         	 silently save the file to the current filename. If it has not been
          	saved before, this will act as if the 
		  	<b>Save As...</b> menu item had been called and
		 	 prompt the user for a filename.
         </p></li><li><p>
          <b>Save As...</b> --- The
		    <b>Save As...</b> menu item allows users to save 
			a file which has not yet been named to a named file. This is always 
			used when a user saves a file which Gnumeric has named by default. 
			This menu item can also be used to save a newly created file or to 
			save an existing file to a new and different name. For an
			explanation of the file formats which gnumeric supports see

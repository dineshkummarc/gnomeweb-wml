>The <SPAN

>Edit</SPAN
> menu is mostly used for
	operations on a worksheet or between worksheets. This menu
	gives users powerful editing operations such as the ability to
	undo recent changes, the ability to cut and paste selections
	of cells and the ability to search for specific cell contents.

>These menu items allow the user to remove recent changes to a
		  worksheet or re-introduce changes which have been undone. These options give
		  the user control over recent edits. This functionality is often
		  called the "change history" of an application. </P
><P
>The type of edit has no importance. An edit which deletes the 
		  contents 
		  of a cell is treated in the same way as an edit which adds contents to 
		  a cell. The change history is session
		  specific. The user will not be able to undo changes through the
		  change history if the
		  file is saved and then re-opened. Note also that the list only covers
		  the last few dozen operations. The number of operations which
		  Gnumeric tracks in its history depends on the size and
		  complexity of those operations. Finally, there are some operations
		  which cannot yet be modified in this way in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric 1.0</SPAN
>. Sheet
		  operations (adding or removal) cannot be undone, nor can deleted
		  comments be restored, nor can altered summary information, nor can
		  operations on embedded objects be undone.

>Cut</SPAN

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Cut</SPAN

				menu item is used to remove a selection from the selected area
				of a currently open workbook. When the menu item is chosen, the
				selected area will be outlined with a moving dotted line. This
				is the area which will be moved. The selection will only be
				removed after it is moved to the new location. Until then cut
				has not had an effect on the worksheet.

				the contents of a selection which has been cut or copied. If
				the selection was cut, it is pasted into the new location

				still point to the same cells.

				a selection while altering certain characteristics. The 
				<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Paste Special...</SPAN

				<SPAN

>The first set of
				choices allow the user to control the data pasted.The user can chose
				to limit the pasting to only the cell contents (no cell
				formatting is copied) or the opposite only cell formats copied
				(no contents). Furthermore, the user can insert the selection
				while transforming all the contents into values only. Formulas
				will not be copied, only the results will be. 
				</P
><P
>A second set of choices allows the user to perform simple
				mathematical transformations during the paste. The data in the
				cells being pasted into are modified by the cell contents. For
				instance, using the divide operation will result in each cell
				in the zone pasted into being divided by the equivalent cell
				which was cut or copied originally.
				</P
><P
>The final choices allow the transposition of the original
				selection or to not paste empty cells. The 
				<SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>transpose</SPAN

				will change the selection so that the cells that are down n
				rows from the selection's origin are pasted as being over n
				columns (and vice-versa). The <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>skip blanks</SPAN
>
				prevents <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> from taking any action for the cells in the
				selection that are blank. Note that the selection will be
				transformed if that option is selected but then that the

				   the elements of the cells in a selection: the formats, the
				   comments, the contents. Alternatively, the user can choose
				   to clear a single one of those elemets. Clearing the formats
				   will leave the data or formula in the cell intact. It will
				   remove any borders, re-set the cell alignments, change the
				   background colour to white and the text colour to black and
				   reset the number format to <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>General</SPAN

				   will simply delete the comments for the cells in that
				   location. Finally clearing the contents will leave the

				   contents of the cell.

>Delete</SPAN

CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>delete</SPAN

				 giving the user a choice of options. Any of the options
				 will completely delete the selected cells. Depending on the
				 selection, <SPAN

>Gnumeric</SPAN
> will fill in the space the cells
				 were occupying differently. With column or row selections,
				 the effect is easy to understand and no choice is possible
				 so <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> does not open the dialog. The space left by
				 selected rows, is filled by moving lower rows up
				 whereas the space filled by deleting columns is filled by
				 moving to the left columns which were right of the selection. 
				 For example, if columns D and E are selected for deletion,
				 <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> will move the contents of all columns from F
				 onwards two columns to the left.
				 </P
><P
>				 With blocks of cells, the <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>delete</SPAN
> 
				 menu item will open a dialog asking the user how to fill in the
				 deleted cells. Blocks of cells will either be filled in by the
				 columns of cells below the block selection or by the rows on 
				 the right of the block. For example, if the user chose the
				 block of cells from E6:G8 for deletion, those cells could be
				 filled in by the cells below E8, F8 and G8 if the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Shift cells
				 up</SPAN
> option were chosen. Alternatively, the cells to the right
				 of G6, G7 and G8 could fill in the space from the right if the
				 <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Shift cells left</SPAN
> option were chosen.

        One of the principal aims of this developers series is to make
        <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> work using only the GTK+
        libraries. These libraries, following their 2.4.0 release,
        have all the functionality needed for the core of
        <span class="application">Gnumeric</span>. This work will remove all
        dependencies in the core code on GNOME libraries although a
        version with the more complete features included in GNOME will
        still exist.

    <span class="application">Gnumeric</span> as stable as it is,  and <span class="emphasis emphasis-bold">Mel Seder</span> who kept us smiling.  They'll be missed.

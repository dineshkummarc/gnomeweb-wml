<p class="para">
      The <span class="guimenu" style="font-weight: bold; ">Edit</span> menu is mostly used for operations
      on a worksheet or between worksheets. This menu gives users
      powerful editing operations such as the ability to undo recent
      changes, the ability to cut and paste selections of cells and
      the ability to search for specific cell contents.

<dd>
	<p class="para">
	  These menu items allow the user to remove recent changes to
	  a worksheet or re-introduce changes which have been
	  undone. These options give the user control over recent
	  edits. This functionality is often called the "change
	  history" of an application. </p>
	
	<p class="para">
	  The type of edit has no importance. An edit which deletes
	  the contents of a cell is treated in the same way as an edit
	  which adds contents to a cell. The change history is session
	  specific. The user will not be able to undo changes through
	  the change history if the file is saved and then
	  re-opened. Note also that the list only covers the last few
	  dozen operations. The number of operations which Gnumeric
	  tracks in its history depends on the size and complexity of
	  those operations. Finally, there are some operations which
	  cannot yet be modified in this way in <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric
	  1.0</span>. Sheet operations (adding or removal)
	  cannot be undone, nor can deleted comments be restored, nor
	  can altered summary information, nor can operations on
	  embedded objects be undone.

	      remove the last few edits from a workbook. The edits
	      must be undone in order. This menu item removes only the
	      last edit from the workbook. The user can also access
	      the undo list through one of the toolbar buttons and its
	      associated menu.  With this menu, the user can undo

	These menu items enable selected cell contents to be moved

	  To use these menuitems, the user must first select the range

	      was cut or copied originally.
	    </p>
	    <p class="para">
	      The final choices allow the transposition of the

	      selection so that the cells that are down n rows from

	      <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> from taking any

				 filled in by the cells below E8, F8 and G8 if the <span class="guilabel" style="font-weight: bold; ">Shift cells

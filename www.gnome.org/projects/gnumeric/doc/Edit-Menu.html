The Edit Menu</h2></div></div><p>The <b>Edit</b> menu is mostly used for
	operations on a worksheet or between worksheets. This menu
	gives users powerful editing operations such as the ability to
	undo recent changes, the ability to cut and paste selections
	of cells and the ability to search for specific cell contents.

The Edit menu.</b></p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/menu-edit-labelled.png" alt="An image of the Edit menu."></div></div></div><p>The menu choices are grouped into the following groups:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><b>
	<span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="figures/label-one.png" alt="An image of the number 1 label."></span>
	  Change History.
	
      </b></dt><dd><p>These menu items allow the user to remove recent changes to a
	  worksheet or re-introduce changes which have been undone. These options give
	  the user control over recent edits. This functionality is often
	  called the "change history" of an application. </p><p>The type of edit has no importance. An edit which deletes the 
	  contents 
	  of a cell is treated in the same way as an edit which adds contents to 
	  a cell. The change history is session
	  specific. The user will not be able to undo changes through the
	  change history if the
	  file is saved and then re-opened. Note also that the list only covers
	  the last few dozen operations. The number of operations which
	  Gnumeric tracks in its history depends on the size and
	  complexity of those operations. Finally, there are some operations
	  which cannot yet be modified in this way in <b><tt>Gnumeric 1.0</tt></b>. Sheet
	  operations (adding or removal) cannot be undone, nor can deleted
	  comments be restored, nor can altered summary information, nor can
	  operations on embedded objects be undone.
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>
	      <b>Undo</b> --- The
	      <b>Undo</b> menu item is used to
	      remove
	      the last few edits from a workbook. The edits must be
	      undone in order. This menu item removes only the last edit
	      from the workbook. The user can also access the undo
	      list through one of the toolbar buttons and its
	      associated menu. 
	      With this menu, the user can undo several
	      operations at once. This is explained in section <a href="std-toolbar.html" title="4.13. The Standard Toolbar">The Standard Toolbar</a>.
	    </p></li><li><p>
	      <b>Redo</b> --- The
	      <b>Redo</b> menu item is used after
	      an undo operation to restore the change that was undone.
	      The menu item only restores the last undone operation. Users
	      can also resotre edit using a button on the standard toolbar
	      and through the associated menu. The menu allows several 
	      operations to be redone at once. It is explained in <a href="std-toolbar.html" title="4.13. The Standard Toolbar">The Standard Toolbar</a>.

	  Operations on selected areas.
	
      </b></dt><dd><p>These menu items enable selected cell contents to be
	moved around a spreadsheet, moved between worksheets or
	between workbooks. Selections are areas of the spreadsheet
	that have been chosen, usually with the mouse, and are usually
	colored pale blue. Selections are explained in greater detail
	in <a href="sect-data-selections.html" title="5.5. Selecting Cells and Cell Ranges">Selecting Cells and Cell Ranges</a>.
	<b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> currently only allows
	single range selections for these operations.
	</p><p> To use these menuitems, the user must first select the range of
	  the cut or copy area. When the user then picks these menuitems, the contents
	  of the selected areas will be entered into the <b><tt>Gnumeric clipboard</tt></b> and
	  into the X clipboard. The contents of the <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> clipboard can then be
	  inserted into a new region of the spreadsheet, into another worksheet or
	  into a new workbook. The X clipboard holds the
	  space delimited results of each cell: either the text or the result of
	  any calculation. The X clipboard can be pasted into any text area.
	  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>
				<b>Cut</b> --- The <b>Cut</b>
				menu item is used to remove a selection from the selected area
				of a currently open workbook. When the menu item is chosen, the
				selected area will be outlined with a moving dotted line. This
				is the area which will be moved. The selection will only be
				removed after it is moved to the new location. Until then cut
				has not had an effect on the worksheet.
				</p></li><li><p>
				<b>Copy</b> --- The 
				  <b>Copy</b> menu item allows a user to
				duplicate a selection. The original data remains where it was
				and the <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> clipboard (and the X clipboard) has a copy 
				which can be inserted elsewhere.
				</p></li><li><p>
				<b>Paste</b> --- The 
				  <b>Paste</b> menu item is used to paste
				the contents of a selection which has been cut or copied. If
				the selection was cut, it is pasted into the new location
				unchanged. Cell references will not change in that they will
				still point to the same cells.
				</p></li><li><p>
				<b>Paste Special...</b> --- The 
				  <b>Paste Special...</b> is used to paste
				a selection while altering certain characteristics. The 
				<b>Paste Special...</b> menu item opens a
				dialog with three categories. The defaults make 
				<b>Paste Special...</b> act as if it were the 
				<b>Paste</b> menu item. 
				</p><p>The first set of
				choices allow the user to control the data pasted.The user can chose
				to limit the pasting to only the cell contents (no cell
				formatting is copied) or the opposite only cell formats copied
				(no contents). Furthermore, the user can insert the selection
				while transforming all the contents into values only. Formulas
				will not be copied, only the results will be. 
				</p><p>A second set of choices allows the user to perform simple
				mathematical transformations during the paste. The data in the
				cells being pasted into are modified by the cell contents. For
				instance, using the divide operation will result in each cell
				in the zone pasted into being divided by the equivalent cell
				which was cut or copied originally.
				</p><p>The final choices allow the transposition of the original
				selection or to not paste empty cells. The 
				<b>transpose</b> check box
				will change the selection so that the cells that are down n
				rows from the selection's origin are pasted as being over n
				columns (and vice-versa). The <b>skip blanks</b>
				prevents <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> from taking any action for the cells in the
				selection that are blank. Note that the selection will be
				transformed if that option is selected but then that the 
				paste will not change the cells in the transformed location if
				this <b>skip blanks</b> option is selected.

			Data removal operations.
			
		</b></dt><dd><p>All of these operations remove data from the worksheet. They
			differ in the type of data removed and the re-arangement of
			remaining data. The differences are explained below.
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>
     	       	<b>Clear</b> --- The
			       <b>clear</b> menu item merely opens a
				   sub-menu with four choices. The user can choose to clear all
				   the elements of the cells in a selection: the formats, the
				   comments, the contents. Alternatively, the user can choose
				   to clear a single one of those elemets. Clearing the formats
				   will leave the data or formula in the cell intact. It will
				   remove any borders, re-set the cell alignments, change the
				   background colour to white and the text colour to black and
				   reset the number format to <b>General</b>. Clearing the comments
				   will simply delete the comments for the cells in that
				   location. Finally clearing the contents will leave the
				   cell's formatting in place but remove the formula or data
				   contents of the cell.
				   </p></li><li><p>
     	       	<b>Delete</b> --- The
			       <b>delete</b> menu item may open a dialog
				 giving the user a choice of options. Any of the options
				 will completely delete the selected cells. Depending on the
				 selection, <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will fill in the space the cells
				 were occupying differently. With column or row selections,
				 the effect is easy to understand and no choice is possible
				 so <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> does not open the dialog. The space left by
				 selected rows, is filled by moving lower rows up
				 whereas the space filled by deleting columns is filled by
				 moving to the left columns which were right of the selection. 
				 For example, if columns D and E are selected for deletion,
				 <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will move the contents of all columns from F
				 onwards two columns to the left.
				 </p><p>
				 With blocks of cells, the <b>delete</b> 
				 menu item will open a dialog asking the user how to fill in the
				 deleted cells. Blocks of cells will either be filled in by the
				 columns of cells below the block selection or by the rows on 
				 the right of the block. For example, if the user chose the
				 block of cells from E6:G8 for deletion, those cells could be
				 filled in by the cells below E8, F8 and G8 if the <b>Shift cells
				 up</b> option were chosen. Alternatively, the cells to the right
				 of G6, G7 and G8 could fill in the space from the right if the
				 <b>Shift cells left</b> option were chosen.

			Other operations on worksheets.
			
		</b></dt><dd><p>These menu entries do not group together logically. Each
			  entry is explained in detail below. </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>
     	       	<b>Sheet</b> --- The
			       <b>Sheet</b> menu item opens up a
				   submenu which allows users to perform operations on the
				   worksheet. Note that this is the same set of choices as are
				   available from the context menu which appears by clicking
				   (usually with the right mouse button) on one of the
				   worksheet tabs. The worksheet can be duplicated to create a
				   second sheet with the same contents. A new worksheet can be
				   inserted immediately following the current sheet. The
				   current sheet can be renamed in a the little pop-up window. The
				   sheets can be re-ordered or the current sheet can be
				   deleted. For this last option <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> asks for confirmation
				   since this choice cannot be undone.
				 </p></li><li><p>
     	       	<b>Select</b> --- The
			       <b>Select</b> menu item allows the user
				 to select various portions of the worksheet. The
				 <b>Select All</b> provides a quick way to
				 select the entire worksheet. The <b>Select
				 Row</b> and <b>Select Column</b>
				 menuitems allow the user to select all the rows or columns 
				 spanned by the current selection.
				 </p><p>
				 The <b>Select Array</b> menu item allows a
				 user to select all the cells which are part of the same array
				 as the current cell. The <b>Select Depends</b> 
				 menu item selects all the cells which are formulas which at
				 least partially need the data in the current cell. 
				 </p></li><li><p>
     	       	<b>Fill</b> --- The
			       <b>Fill</b> menu item opens a submenu
				 with only one choice currently. The 
				 <b>Autoill</b> menu item will fill an
				 entire selection with any formula which is in the top left
				 cell of the selection. 
				 </p></li><li><p>
     	       	<b>Search...</b> --- The
			       <b>Search...</b> menu item opens a dialog
				 to search for cells with particular content. The dialog has
				 three tabs. In the first the user can enter the information
				 the user wants to find and some constraints on the search. The
				 second tab gives some extra choices for the search. When the
				 user has picked the options they perfer, pushing the search
				 button on the first tab will run the search. The third tab
				 will show which cells match the search.
				 </p></li><li><p>
     	       	<b>Search and Replace...</b> --- The
			       <b>Search and Replace...</b> menu item
				 will launch a dialog to find cells with particular
				 characteristics and replace them all with a common content.
				 This dialog is similar to the <b>Search</b>
				 dialog.
				 </p></li><li><p>
     	       	<b>Goto cell...</b> --- The
			       <b>Goto cell...</b> menuitemn opens up a
				   dialog which allows the user to type the name of a cell in
				   the worksheet. The current view will then change to be sure
				   that the selected cell is in the current view and the
				   selection will cover that cell.
				 </p></li><li><p>
     	       		<b>Recalculate</b> --- The
			       	  <b>Recalculate</b> menu item forces
					the workbook to recalculate its results. This is useful
					if a formula in the current worksheet depends on a cell in
					a different workbook. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will not necessarily know
					when that data has been updated so a user can force
					<b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> to recalculate all the cells in the current
					workbook.

      Inserting an image is performed like inserting any other
      graphical element using the menu entry to start the process,
      then selecting the file, and finally using the mouse to place
      the image above the worksheet.

	    <span class="guimenuitem" style="font-weight: bold; ">Image</span> menu item using the mouse
	    cursor and the primary mouse button. This will open a

	    In the dialog which appears the user must select the file
	    which contains the desired image. The dialog will be
	    specific to the particular operating system platform but
	    should provide a way to navigate the filesystem to pick
	    the folder that contains the file and have a way to select
	    the file or type its name. When these choices have been
	    made, the dialog can be dismissed by double clicking on
	    the file or by clicking on the <span class="guibutton" style="font-weight: bold; ">Open</span>
	    button. This will dismiss the dialog and expose the
	    worksheet, with the mouse pointer now converted to a thin
	    cross-hair.

	    The image, which will float like other graphical elements
	    above the worksheet, must be placed on the worksheet. The
	    image can be placed with its default size by
	    moving the thin cross-hair pointer above the worksheet and
	    clicking with the primary mouse button. Alternatively, the
	    image can be placed and sized by selecting two of the
	    resulting corners. This is done by moving the thin
	    cross-hair pointer over the worksheet, determining one
	    corner by clicking and holding the primary mouse button,
	    dragging the pointer to the opposite corner, and releasing
	    the mouse button. The image will then appear between the
	    place where the primary mouse button was pressed and the
	    place the button was released.

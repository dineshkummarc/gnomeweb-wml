      Saving a workbook to a file can be a simple process, depending
      on the folder in which the file is to be saved. If this folder
      is in the predefined list of standard folders and user bookmark

      <span class="interface">File Save</span> dialog. The components of the
      compact <span class="interface">File Save</span> dialog and the
      procedure to save a workbook to a file in the predefined list of

      However, when the workbook is to be saved to a file created in a

<p class="para">
	  All documents are stored in a folder. Folders can contain
	  files but can also contain other folders. Any folder
	  therefore can contain several sub-folders, each of which may
	  itself contain several sub-folders; the resulting structure
	  is called a nested 'tree' with the original folder being the
	  'relative root' of that tree.
        </p>
<p class="para">
	  In GNU and UNIX systems, all of the files are stored in
	  folders organized in a single, unified filesystem tree with
	  a folder named '<span class="filename" style="font-family: monospace; ">/</span>' at the absolute root
	  of the tree. Every file is accessible from this absolute
	  root folder and, by default, this folder is provided as the

	  points in area <span class="emphasis" style="font-weight: bold; ">F</span>. These
	  will be called, in this documentation, the 'relative root'
	  folders since each of these will act as the root of the

<p class="para">

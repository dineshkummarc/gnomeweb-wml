Data in Gnumeric</h2></div></div><p>
    The main purpose of spreadsheets like
    <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> is to collect information in a
    coherent manner, perform calculations on the information and then
    be able to update those calculations easily if the original
    numbers change. The use of a spreadsheet therefore requires a
    substantial understanding of the types of information which can be
    entered into the spreadsheet and the methods which can be used to
    manipulate that information. This section explains how data can be
    used in <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>.
  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2833144"></a>3.5.1. The Types of Data in a Spreadsheet</h3></div></div><p>
      Spreadsheets like <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> treat
      information by separating the data into separate cells and
      considering the data in each cell to be separate elements. Each
      cell in the spreadsheet has both a value, which is what
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> manipulates, and a
      representation, which is what is actually shown. Understanding
      this distinction is complicated and make take the new user some
      time but this also contributes to the usefulness of spreadsheets
      in general.
    </p><p>
      The cells of the spreadsheet are contained in the cell grid
      area. The cell grid area is the area with a white background and
      grey grid lines. The grid lines separate this area into
      separate cells. Each cell has a unique reference name which is
      the combination of the letters of the name of the column and the
      number of the row. For instance, the top, leftmost cell is the
      cell named &quot;A1&quot; and the cell two over to the right and four rows
      down is named &quot;C4.&quot; Each of these cells can contain one datum.
    </p><p>
      The data elements contained in any cell will have values of one
      of five types: text strings, number values, formulas, boolean
      values or error values. These five types of data values can then
      have various display formats so that, for instance, number
      values can represent numbers, currency, dates or times. Text
      strings are sequences of characters and punctuation marks and
      could, for example, contain textual information such as peoples
      names. Number values are simply numbers but may be input and
      displayed in various formats including decimal numbers, dates,
      times, and scientific notation. Formulas are instructions to
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> to calculate a result. The
      power of spreadsheets comes from these formulas because the
      results of the calculation can depend on the contents of other
      cells. Boolean values are either TRUE or FALSE and can be used
      in logical statements. Error values are usually the result of
      mistakes or impossible calculations.
    </p><p>
      For more information on the types of data usable in
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>, see <a href="sect-data-types.html" title="5.2. The Types of Cell Elements">The Types of Cell Elements</a>.
    </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2833251"></a>3.5.2. Putting Data into the spreadsheet</h3></div></div><p>
      In order to enter data into the spreadsheet, the user must first
      select a cell in which to place the information and then
      actually type the information on the keyboard. Once the
      information is entered, <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>
      attempts to figure out both the appropriate data value type to
      assign to the cell and the appropriate data format in which to
      display this data value. Because this process is quite complex,
      users may occasionally be forced to actively select these
      parameters of the cells, which is explained in <a href="quick-format.html" title="3.6. Cell Formats">Cell Formats</a> below. The next two sections explain
      how to get data into a cell, first by moving the selection box
      to a desired cell and then by typing the data.
    </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2833293"></a>3.5.2.1. Moving the selection box</h4></div></div><p>
        In order to enter data into
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> the selection box must be
        placed over the appropriate cell. The selection box appears on
        the cell grid as a double line rectangle with a small grey
        square in the lower right corner. By default the selection box
        surrounds the top, leftmost cell in the cell grid area.
      </p><p>
        The simplest way to move the selection box is to use the
        mouse. If the mouse cursor is placed over the cell &quot;C3&quot; (the
        cursor will be represented as a thick white cross) and the
        left mouse button then clicked, the selection box will move to
        cell &quot;C3&quot;. Note that the selection box can cover more than one
        cell if the mouse is dragged while being clicked. The use of
        these larger selections is explained below in <a href="quick-complex-select.html" title="3.7. Complex Cell Selections">Complex Cell Selections</a>.
      </p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/tip.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Tip</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">
          The selection box also causes the header of the column and
          row to change slightly. The headers will turn a darker shade
          of gray and the font of the letters and numbers turn
          bold. This helps indicate what is currently being selected.
        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        The selection box can also be moved with the keyboard arrow
        keys. For instance, typing the right arrow twice and the down
        arrow once will move the selection box from the cell &quot;C3&quot; to
        the cell &quot;E4&quot;.
      </p><p>
        The selection box can be moved in other ways and will move in
        response to certain actions. These movements become intuitive
        after using <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> for a little
        while.
      </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2833376"></a>3.5.2.2. Data Input</h4></div></div><p>
        In order to enter data into a selected cell, one can simply
        start typing. The characters will then become part of the
        spreadsheet when the selection is changed by typing the
        <b>Enter</b> key, which moves the selection down one
        cell, by typing the <b>Tab</b> key, which moves the
        selection one cell to the right, or by selecting any other
        cell with the mouse.
      </p><p>
        For example, the mouse could be used to select the cell four
        columns over (Column D) and three rows down (Row 3). Then the
        user could type &quot;Hello, this is a line of text.&quot; and then type
        the <b>Enter</b> key. The text would then appear in
        cell &quot;D3&quot; and, if the cells to the right are empty, would span
        into those cells so that the whole entry is visible. The
        selection box moves when the <b>Enter</b> key is
        typed so that it is below in cell &quot;D4&quot;, ready for the input of
        more data.
      </p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">
          Note that as the data text is entered it appears in both the
          cell and in the data entry area (the area below the toolbars
          to the right of the equals (=) sign).
        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        Mistakes which are made during data entry can be corrected by
        using the <b>Backspace</b> key, the arrow keys to
        navigate backwards and forwards and the
        <b>Delete</b> key. The mouse can be used in the text
        entry area but not in the cell area directly.
      </p><p>
        The contents of a cell can be changed simply by selecting the
        cell again and either typing the new contents or editing the
        current contents of the cells.
      </p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img src="./stylesheet/note.png"></img></td><th align="left" valign="top">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p xmlns="">
          If the content of the cell is too large for the size of the
          cell, the entry may span over the edge of the cell into the
          empty cells to the right. If the cell is a number, the cell
          grid area may display hash marks (######) to indicate the
          cell has content which is too large to display in the given
          cell width.
        </p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2833493"></a>3.5.2.3. Data recognition</h4></div></div><p>
        As data are entered into the spreadsheet,
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> interprets the information
        in order, first, to assign it to a data category and, second,
        to give it an appropriate data display format. The entry will
        be assigned to one of the basic data types and possibly to a
        sub-type. Entries which start with an apostrophe (') are
        considered to be text no matter what the rest of the
        contents. Entries which start with an equals sign (=) are
        automatically considered to be a formula. Entries which are
        single numbers or which fall into commonly used patterns for
        dates or times will be considered to be numbers.
      </p><p>
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> usually figures out what
        the data is meant to be but occasionally the user will have to
        force <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> to consider the data
        to be a different data type than
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> would guess by
        default. The details of this process is explained in greater
        detail in the extended chapter on data, <a href="data.html" title="Chapter 5. Working with Data">Chapter 5</a>. 
      </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2833563"></a>3.5.2.4. Entering text</h4></div></div><p>
        Entering text simply requires selecting the appropriate cell,
        typing the text and then the <b>Enter</b> key. If the
        text is too large to fit in its own cell, and the cell to its
        right is empty, the text will span into the cell on the
        right. By default, <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> uses a
        display format for text in which the contents are shown left
        justified.
      </p><p>
        For more information about text elements, see <a href="sect-data-types.html#sect-data-text" title="5.2.1. Text Data Elements">Text Data Elements</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2833610"></a>3.5.2.5. Entering numbers</h4></div></div><p>
        Entering numbers requires selecting the appropriate cell,
        typing in a number and then the <b>Enter</b>
        key. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> recognizes several
        types of information to be numbers.
      </p><p>
        The simplest kind of input which
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> recognizes as numbers are
        standard numeric values. Technically, these are contiguous
        sequences of digits which may have a separator symbol between
        the thousands and another symbol indicating the decimal
        separator. These symbols follow the English convention by
        default (comma as thousand separator, period as decimal
        symbol) but will adopt the symbols appropriate for a different
        locality if <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> is launched in
        a particular way. For instance, in a French setting the period
        is the thousand separator symbol and the comma the decimal
        separator symbol.  By
        default, <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will display
        these numeric values lined up against the right side of the
        cell.
      </p><p>
        Several other types of input are recognized as numeric values
        which means that calculations can be performed on the values
        in the cells.
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>
            Dates in the standard format of the locale are recognized
            as numbers. By default, inputing 11/21/1970 will be
            recognized as the twenty-first of November of the year
            nineteen seventy. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>
            stores the value as the number of days since the first day
            of January in 1900.
          </p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>
            Time values, such as 10:34 or 11:23:45 PM, are recognized
            as number values. These values are stored in
            <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> as fractions of the
            whole day. 
          </p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>
            Percentage values can be input simply by appending the
            percent symbol (%) to the value.
          </p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>
            Fractions can be input and are recognized as values.
            
          </p></li><li style="list-style-type: circle"><p>
            Numeric values can be input using scientific notation. For
            instance, 1.003e+6 will be recognized as the value one
            million three thousand.
          </p></li></ul></div><p>
        For more information on numbers, see <a href="sect-data-types.html#sect-data-numbers" title="5.2.2. Number Data Elements">Number Data Elements</a>.
      </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2833792"></a>3.5.2.6. Entering a Formula</h4></div></div><p>
        Entering a formula requires selecting a cell and typing in the
        equals sign (=) and then a valid formula. If
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> cannot understand the
        formula which is entered, it will open a dialog box which may
        have an explanation and gives the user a chance either to
        re-edit the expression or to accept the entry as a text entry
        instead of a formula. The second choice makes it easy to
        re-edit the entry into a valid formula simply by fixing the
        formula and removing the leading apostrophe (') before the
        equals sign.
      </p><p>
        Formulas can be quite complex since the power of spreadsheets
        comes from these formulas. A simple example of the use of a
        formula is as follows: First select cell B2 and input the
        value &quot;3&quot; into that cell. Secondly, select cell D4 and input
        (without the quotes) &quot;=B2+2&quot; and then type the
        <b>Enter</b> key. Cell D4 should display the value
        &quot;5&quot;. If the value of cell B2 is changed from &quot;3&quot; to &quot;100&quot;,
        <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will automatically update
        the value of cell D4 to &quot;102&quot;.
      </p><p>
        A valid formula can be a simple arithmetic equation such as 
        <pre class="screen">
          =3+4-1
        </pre>
        which uses a formula to make the cell equal to the value
        6.
      </p><p>
        Formulas may include calls to functions. These are statements
        which indicate that more complex operations should be
        performed. For instance, a formula could be &quot;=EXP(24)&quot; which
        would give the value of e (the base of the natural logarithm)
        raised to the 24th power. The cell would then display
        &quot;2.6489e+10&quot;.
      </p><p>
        As was shown in the example above, formulas may contain
        `references' to the contents of another cell. In the example
        given above, the contents of the cell in the second column and
        the second row was used in a calculation by using the cell
        name &quot;B2&quot;. These references mean that complex calculations can
        be automatically updated when one of the original values
        change. 
      </p><p>
        References can be made to the cells in other worksheets and
        even to those in other workbooks (files). The basic format of
        a complete reference is made of the name of the file the
        reference is in, enclosed by square brackets, followed by the
        name of the sheet, followed by an exclamation point, followed
        by the letters of the column, followed by the number of the
        row. For example, a complete reference could be
        &quot;[my_file.gnumeric]&quot;Sheet3&quot;!C3&quot;. These complete references can
        be shortened if the filename or sheet names are the same as
        that of the reference. &quot;AE34&quot; would refer to the cell in the
        current file, in the current worksheet which is in column &quot;AE&quot;
        and in row &quot;34&quot;.
      </p><p>
        References can refer to a range of contiguous range of
        cells. For instance, the reference &quot;A1: E5&quot; refers to all the
        cells from the top-left most cell of the current sheet to the
        cell five rows down and five rows over. This can be useful in
        a formula which uses a function such as MAX(). The formula
        &quot;=MAX(A1:E5)&quot; would display the value of the largest number
        value in this range of cells.
      </p><p>

        in <a href="sect-data-types.html#sect-data-formulas-references" title="5.2.4.3. Cell Referencing">Cell Referencing</a> later on in this

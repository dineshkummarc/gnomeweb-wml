Moving Cell Contents, Inserting New Cells or Deleting Cells</h2></div></div><p>
    The contents of cells, both data values and formatting, can be
    moved from one part of a spreadsheet to another so that data do
    not have to be re-entered if the spreadsheet is reorganized. New
    cells can be added to a spreadsheet and old cells removed but
    these latter operations cause the layout of the spreadsheet to be
    altered.
  </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2834479"></a>3.8.1. Moving Cell Contents</h3></div></div><p>
      The simplest way to move cell contents around a spreadsheet
      involves selecting a block of cells containing the contents to
      be moved, either &quot;cutting&quot; or &quot;copying&quot; those cells, selecting
      the location where these contents are to be moved and then
      pasting the data.
    </p><p>
      Moving data can only be performed with a single selection of
      cells which means that only continous rectangular blocks of
      cells can be moved. This does mean, however, that columns or
      rows can be moved as a unit. By default,
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> moves the entire contents of
      the cells including both the data values and the formatting of
      the cells.
    </p><p>
      Once a group of cells is selected, they can be &quot;cut&quot; or &quot;copied&quot;
      either using the <b>Edit</b> menu, the toolbar
      buttons (a pair of scissors or two pieces of paper, respectively),
      the right mouse button context menu or keyboard shortcuts
      (Ctrl+X or
      Ctrl+C
      respectively). If cells are &quot;cut&quot; the contents will be removed
      from the current location. If cells are &quot;copied&quot;, the contents
      will be duplicated in the new location. These two operations
      treat cell references in formulas slightly differently. If cells
      are &quot;cut&quot;, any references in the cells in the new location will
      remain pointed at the original cells. If cells are &quot;copied&quot;, the
      references in the cells in the new location will point to cells
      in the same relative position.
    </p><p>
      The new location for the cells can be selected in two ways. The
      simplest is to select the top, left cell of the new
      location. Alternatively, the whole new range of cells can be
      selected but the shape of this new range must match exactly the
      dimensions of the original range which is more difficult.
    </p><p>
      Finally the cell contents can be &quot;pasted&quot; in the new location
      using either the <b>Edit</b> menu
      <b>Paste</b> menu entry, the toolbar button
      with a clipboard, the context menu
      <b>Paste</b> menu entry or the
      Ctrl+V
      keyboard shortcut.
    </p><p>
      An alternative way to move cells in a current worksheet involves
      dragging and dropping the original selection. The cells to be
      moved are selected as above. The mouse cursor is then placed on
      the thick white selection border. If the left hand button is
      clicked and held, the selected cells can be dragged to a new
      location resulting in the same operation as a &quot;cut&quot; and a
      &quot;paste&quot;. If the Ctrl key is held down during
      the click and drag of the mouse, the result is the same as a
      &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;paste&quot; operation and can be repeated several times.
    </p><p>
      Both the <b>Edit</b> menu and the context menu have
      an extra menu entry called <b>Paste
      Special...</b> which can be used during a cut and
      paste operation to seletively transfer some of the original the
      cell contents or to alter the contents in specific ways. This
      option allows the transfer of only the cell contents, only the
      cell formats or only the calculated values of the cells. The
      transfered contents can also be mathematically combined with the
      current contents of cells in the new location. Alternatively,
      the selection can be transposed. See <a href="sect-movecopy.html#sect-movecopy-pastespecial" title="5.5.3. Paste Special">Paste Special</a> for more information on
      the <b>Paste Special...</b> command.

      A worksheet can also be altered by inserting or by deleting
      cells. These operations actually alter the locations of cells in
      a workbook.
    </p><p>
      Inserting and deleting columns and rows are easy to
      understand. If a group of columns or rows is selected, selecting
      the <b>Column</b> or
      <b>Row</b> menu entries in the
      <b>Insert</b> menu will add the same number of
      columns to the left of the selected columns or of rows above the
      selected rows. The context menu can also be used for the insert
      operation. The context menu can be used to delete the currently
      selected columns or rows.

        Insert operations can result in the loss of data if the last
        columns or rows currently contain information.
      </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
      Individual cells or contiguious rectangular blocks of cells can
      also be inserted and deleted. During this operation, the user is
      asked which way to shift the current cells to allow the
      insertion or deletion of the selected cells. The movement can be
      along the rows or along the columns and will result in the
      relative movement of cells which were previously
      contiguous. This shift is the fundamental difference between
      insert and delete operations compared to cut or copy and paste
      operations.

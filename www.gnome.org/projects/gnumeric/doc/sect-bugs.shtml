    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> is a complex computer program
    and therefore necessarily contains some mistakes. The
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> team is keenly interested in
    finding these errors and correcting them. Suggestions for
    improvement are also welcome and can be submitted in the same
    fashion as an error report.

    Reports of problems with <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span>
    provide the project with a way of making sure that the mistake is
    eventually fixed. Often the mistake is obvious and a fix can be
    made immediately to be included in the very next release of
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span>. Occasionally, the mistake is
    more complex and the problem may take a while to be resolved. In
    these cases, the report provides a way to remind the developers that
    the problem still exists.

      Mistakes in programs are often called "bugs" after one of the
      earliest errors in an old machine which was actually caused
      by an insect entering the machine and preventing a switch from
      closing.

    The <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> project uses a world wide
    web system called <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Bugzilla</span> to collect
    reports of program errors and then to track these errors until
    they are finally fixed. The system was developed as part of the
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Mozilla</span> web browser project, which
    explains the origin of the strange name.

    The process of submitting the report of a problem or of a
    suggested enhancement is quite simple and can be completed in just
    a few steps. The process begins with obtaining a good
    understanding of the problem to be able to provide a detailed
    statement explaining the problem exactly. Next, the user must open
    an account with the GNOME project's
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Bugzilla</span> system. Finally, the user must
    submit the statement of the problem, ideally, along with some
    information about the computer setup being used by the person
    experiencing the problem.

    The main purpose of spreadsheets like
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> is to collect information in a
    coherent manner, perform calculations on the information and then
    be able to update those calculations easily if the original
    numbers change. The use of a spreadsheet therefore requires a
    substantial understanding of the types of information which can be
    entered into the spreadsheet and the methods which can be used to
    manipulate that information. This section explains how data can be
    used in <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span>.
  </p><div class="sect2"><h2 class="sect2 title"><span class="title"><span class="label">3.5.1. </span>The Types of Data in a Spreadsheet</span></h2><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      Spreadsheets like <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> treat
      information by separating the data into separate cells and
      considering the data in each cell to be separate elements. Each
      cell in the spreadsheet has both a value, which is what
      <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> manipulates, and a
      representation, which is what is actually shown. Understanding
      this distinction is complicated and make take the new user some
      time. This distinction is one of the reasons spreadsheets are so
      useful.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      The cells of the spreadsheet are contained in the cell grid
      area. The cell grid area is the area with a white background and
      grey grid lines. The grid lines separate this area into separate
      cells. Each cell has a unique reference name which is the
      combination of the letters of the name of the column and the
      number of the row. For instance, the top, leftmost cell is the
      cell named "A1" and the cell two over to the right and four rows
      down is named "C4" because it is in the column labelled "C" and
      in the fourth row. Each of these cells can contain only one
      single datum.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      The datum contained in any cell will have one of five types: a
      text string type, a number type, a formula type, a boolean type
      or an error type. These five types of data values can then have
      various display formats so that, for instance, a number value
      can be displayed as a number, a monetary amount, a date or a
      time. Text strings are sequences of characters and punctuation
      marks and could, for example, contain textual information such
      as peoples names. Number values are simply numbers but may be
      input and displayed in various formats including decimal
      numbers, dates, times, and numbers in scientific
      notation. Formulas are instructions to
      <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> to calculate a result. The
      power of spreadsheets comes from these formulas because the
      results of the calculation can depend on the contents of other
      cells. Boolean values are either TRUE or FALSE and can be used
      in logical statements. Error values are usually the result of
      mistakes or impossible calculations.

      In order to enter data into the spreadsheet, the user must first
      select a cell in which to place the information and then
      actually type the information on the keyboard. Once the
      information is entered, <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span>
      attempts to figure out both the appropriate data value type to
      assign to the cell and the appropriate data format in which to
      display this data value. Because this process is quite complex,
      users may occasionally be forced to actively select these
      parameters of the cells, which is explained in <a class="xref" href="quick-format.shtml" title="Cell Formats">Section 3.6 ― Cell Formats</a> below. The next two sections explain
      how to get data into a cell, first by moving the selection box
      to a desired cell and then by typing the data.
    </p><div class="sect3"><h3 class="sect3 title"><span class="title"><span class="label">3.5.2.1. </span>Moving the selection box</span></h3><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        In order to enter data into
        <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> the selection box must be
        placed over the appropriate cell. The selection box appears on
        the cell grid as a double lined rectangle with a small grey
        square in the lower right corner of the box. By default the
        selection box surrounds the top, leftmost cell in the cell
        grid area.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The simplest way to move the selection box is to use the
        mouse. If the mouse cursor is placed over the cell "C3" (the
        cursor will be represented as a thick white cross) and the
        left mouse button then clicked, the selection box will move to
        cell "C3". Note that the selection box can cover more than one
        cell if the mouse is dragged while being clicked. The use of
        these larger selections is explained below in <a class="xref" href="quick-complex-select.shtml" title="Complex Cell Selections">Section 3.7 ― Complex Cell Selections</a>.
      </p><div class="admonition block-indent tip">
        <p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
          The selection box also causes the header of the column and
          row to change slightly. The headers will turn a darker shade
          of gray and the font of the letters and numbers turn
          bold. This helps indicate what is currently being selected.
        </p>
      </div><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The selection box can also be moved with the keyboard arrow
        keys. For instance, typing the right arrow twice and the down
        arrow once will move the selection box from the cell "C3" to
        the cell "E4".
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The selection box can be moved in other ways and will move in
        response to certain actions. These movements become intuitive
        after using <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> for a little
        while.
      </p></div><div class="sect3"><h3 class="sect3 title"><span class="title"><span class="label">3.5.2.2. </span>Data Input</span></h3><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        In order to enter data into a selected cell, one can simply
        start typing. The characters will then become part of the
        spreadsheet when the selection is changed either by typing the
        <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Enter</span> key, which moves the selection down one
        cell, by typing the <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Tab</span> key, which moves the
        selection one cell to the right, or by selecting any other
        cell with the mouse.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        For example, the mouse could be used to select the cell four
        columns over (Column D) and three rows down (Row 3). Then the
        user could type "Hello, this is a line of text." and then type
        the <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Enter</span> key. The text would then appear in
        cell "D3" and, if the cells to the right are empty, would span
        into those cells so that the whole entry is visible. The
        selection box moves when the <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Enter</span> key is
        typed and will therefore appear afterwards in cell "D4", ready
        for the input of more data.
      </p><div class="admonition block-indent note">
        <p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
          Note that as the data text is entered it appears in both the
          cell and in the data entry area (the area below the toolbars
          to the right of the equals (=) sign).
        </p>
      </div><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        Mistakes which are made during data entry can be corrected by
        using the <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Backspace</span> key or the
        <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Delete</span> key. Finer control can be obtained if
        the cursor is moved to the text entry area by clicking in the
        box to the right of the equals (=) sign with the
        mouse. Editing in the text entry area enables the arrow keys
        to navigate backwards and forwards within the text being
        entered and also enables the mouse to be used to move the
        cursor.
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        The contents of a cell can be changed simply by selecting the

        The simplest kind of input which

        standard numeric values. Technically, these are contiguous
        sequences of digits which may have a separator symbol between
        the thousands and another symbol indicating the decimal
        separator. These symbols follow the English convention by

        symbol) but will adopt the symbols appropriate for a different
        locality if <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> is launched in
        a particular way. For instance, in a French setting the period

        Formulas can be quite complex since the power of spreadsheets

        (without the quotes) "=B2+2" and then type the
        <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Enter</span> key. Cell D4 should display the value

      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        A valid formula can be a simple arithmetic equation such as 
        <div class="screen block-indent"><pre class="screen">=3+4-1

        Formulas may include calls to functions. These are statements
        which indicate that more complex operations should be
        performed. For instance, a formula could be "=EXP(24)" which
        would give the value of e (the base of the natural logarithm)
        raised to the 24th power. The cell would then display
        "2.6489e+10".
      </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
        As was shown in the example above, formulas may contain
        `references' to the contents of another cell. In the example
        given above, the contents of the cell in the second column and
        the second row was used in a calculation by using the cell

        References can be made to the cells in other worksheets and

        a complete reference is made of the name of the file the
        reference is in, enclosed by square brackets, followed by the
        name of the sheet, followed by an exclamation point, followed
        by the letters of the column, followed by the number of the
        row. For example, a complete reference could be
        "[my_file.gnumeric]"Sheet3"!C3". These complete references can
        be shortened if the filename or sheet names are the same as
        that of the reference. "AE34" would refer to the cell in the

        cells from the top-left most cell of the current sheet to the
        cell five rows down and five rows over. This can be useful in
        a formula which uses a function such as MAX(). The formula

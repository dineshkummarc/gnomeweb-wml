    There are several ways to add data into a spreadsheet. The
    simplest data entry technique involves typing the data into a
    spreadsheet by hand. This is usually necessary the first time that
    data are introduced into a computer. If the data already exist in
    a computer file of some kind, a simple way might exist to insert
    these data into a <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>
    worksheet. If the data are in a text file, they can be inserted
    into a worksheet rapidly using the text conversion facilities. If
    data exist in a spreadsheet file of a different format,
    <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> may be able to open the file
    and the data can then be copied where they are wanted.
  </p><p>
    This section explains how to enter data by hand into a
    spreadsheet. The techniques necessary to obtain data from other
    computer sources are explained in <a href="files.html" title="Chapter 9. File Opening and Saving">Chapter 9</a> which
    deals with external data sources.

      If the information being entered into
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> cannot be interpreted
      correclty, <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will display an
      error message. The user may then be forced to edit the data
      before continuing. For example, a formula may be mathematically
      incorrect if the user has two operators in a row (e.g. =3+*4)
      and the diaolog will give the user the chance to re-edit the
      entry or accept the entry as text rather than as a formula. When
      the formula is corrected, the leading apostrophe can be removed
      and <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will re-interpret the
      entry as a formula.

      The simplest method to place data in a spreadsheet involves
      selecting the location for the data, typing the data on a
      keyboard and then typing the Enter key to
      finish the input.
    </p><div class="procedure"><p><b>Simple Data Entry</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>
          Select the cell where you want to enter data by clicking on

        </p></li><li><p>
          Type in the data or formula. The details of this step are
          presented below for each of the five types of data which can
          be entered.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Press the Enter key. This will complete the
          input and move the selection box down one cell which will
          then be able to recieve further input.

        At any time while entering the data and before the
        Enter is pressed, the user can cancel the

        Instead of the Enter key, other keys can be
        used to input the data in the current cell. These other keys
        will move the selection box to other locations than does the
        Enter key. The Tab key
        inputs the entry in the currently selected cell and then moves
        the selection box one cell to the right of the current
        cell. The arrow keys input the entry into the currently
        selected cell and move one cell in the direction of the
        arrow. The Enter key can also be used in
        conjunction with other keys. Typing the
        Shift+Enter
        combination will move the selection upwards after

        mistakes in this mode is the backspace key.
      </p><p>
        For a more complete set of editing options, especially for
        longer entries, there is an advanced editing mode.  To enter
        the advanced editing mode, press the <b>F2</b>
        function key or click on the editing region. The keyboard
        focus will then shift from the current cell to the editing
        region at the top of the worksheet. There, you can use cursor
        keys to position the cursor within the data in the cell, and
        have all of the capabilities of the data entry area available.
      </p><p>
         For example, you can use:

        It is sometimes necessary to enter large amounts of data by

        If data are to be entered into a series of rows or columns,
        this region can be selected ahead of time thereby modifying

        The entry of large amounts of data into a spreadsheet is
        tedious work which is prone to repeated
        mistakes. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> provides a tool
        to automatically correct commonly made simple mistakes. The
        corrections are configured and activated using AutoCorrect
        Dialog, available via <b>Auto Correct</b>
        in the <b>Tools</b> menu.

     too long while typing initial letters.  When it happens, you will
     get two initial capitals instead of one.  If this correction rule
     is activated, the second letter of words beginning with two
     capital letters is automatically lowercased.  For example, if you

          It is often necessary to enter a regular sequence of numbers
          or a repeated sequence of
          text. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> provides several
          ways to input series and sequences of this kind.
        </p><p>
          The simplest way to fill a series with the same element
          repeated involves entering the element once and dragging the
          selection box to fill that element repeatedly. For example,
          the text &quot;employee:&quot; could be input into cell C2. That cell
          could then be selected. The selection box is a thick white
          rectangle which surrounds the cell. This selection box has a
          small white square at the bottom right hand corner. If the
          mouse cursor is placed above this square box, it changes to
          a thin cross. If the left hand mouse button is clicked and
          held, and the mouse dragged to cell C10,
          <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will automatically fill
          all of the cells with the identical string.
        </p><p>
          An alternative way to enter data into a region involves
          first selecting the region, then typing the value and
          finally typing the
          Ctrl+Enter
          key combination. This will fill the whole region with the
          identical value which was originally entered.
        </p><p>
          A similar method is available to fill sequences of
          integers. If the example just given was altered so that cell
          C2 had the number 14 and the Ctrl key was
          held during the dragging of the selection,
          <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will automatically fill
          the cells C2 to C10 with the series 14,15,16,...,22.
        </p><p>
          More complex series and sequences of data can be entered
          with a similar mechanism. 
        </p><p>
          To do an autofill:
        </p><div class="procedure"><ol type="1"><li><p>
	    Enter a value into the first cell you wish to
	    autofill. For example, the cell C2 could have the number
	    &quot;24&quot; entered.
	  </p></li><li><p>
	    Enter a second value into the second cell you wish to
	    autofill. This must be adjacent to the first cell. This
	    sets the increment to use when autofilling the rest of
	    your cells. For example, the cell D2 could have the number
	    &quot;28&quot; entered.
	  </p></li><li><p>
	    Select both the cells just entered. At the bottom-right of
	    the selection should be a small box. Your mouse cursor
	    will change to a cross-hair when placed over the box.
	    Press and hold on the box. Drag in the direction, either
	    vertical or horizonatal, you wish to increment and release
	    when all the cells are filled. For example, selecting
	    cells C2 and D2, then dragging the bottom right of the
	    selection to cell I2 will fill the cells with the sequence
	    from 24 to 48 with each increment being 4.
	  </p></li></ol></div><p>
          An alternative to the last step involves using the
          menus. Once the first two values have been input, the whole
          range to be filled can be selected using the mouse and then
          the <b>Autofill</b> selection can be
          made from the <b>Edit</b> and
          <b>Fill</b>. This will automatically
          complete the series in the selected region.
        </p><p>
	  <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> is able to increment
	  several types of data beyond simple integers. The proceedure
	  is the same as described above but involves different
	  starting values. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> can
	  increment:
	<div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><b>Integers</b></dt><dd><p>
		1, 2, 3, etc.
	      </p></dd><dt><b>Natural Numbers</b></dt><dd><p>

		11/14/2001, 11/15/2001, etc.
	      </p><p>
		<b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> supports
		incrementing the date by month, date, or year.
	      </p><p>
		  Note that, While <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b>
		  will increment days of the month, if you do
		  11/14/2001 and 12/14/2001, it will recognize it as
		  the same day of the month and increment the month so
		  the next value would be to 1/14/2002 instead of the
		  day difference.
		</p></dd></dl></div>
        </p><p>
          <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> can be explicitly told
          the cells to autofill as in the examples above, but it can
          also guess the number of cells to fill based on the length
          of an adjacent column or row. For example, if the cells B2
          to B10 have information and cell C2 has the integer value
          &quot;1&quot;, then selecting cell C2 and double clicking on the
          bottom rightmost box of the selection rectangle will fill
          the value &quot;1&quot; from cell C3 to cell C10.

      Formulas can be entered simply by typing a syntactically correct
      formula in a cell. The correct syntax for formulas is expalined
      in detail in <a href="sect-data-types.html#sect-data-formulas" title="5.2.4. Formula Elements">Formula Elements</a>. Formulas
      begin with an equals sign (=) and contain arithmetic symbols,
      functions with their arguments and cell references.
    </p><p>
      To enter a formula, first the cell must be selected, then the
      correct formula must be typed, and finally the
      Enter key must be typed.

        If the formula entered into

        error message giving the user the choice of re-editng the
        formula or saving the formula as a text field to be edited
        later. For example, a formula may be mathematically incorrect
        if the user has two operators in a row (e.g. =3+*4). If the
        formula is saved as text, when the formula is corrected the
        leading apostrophe must be
        removed. <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> will then

      </h4></div></div><p>
        Formulas often include cell references or references to ranges
        of cells as arguments to functions. These references and
        ranges can be entered into a formula simply by typing in the
        proper syntax (see <a href="sect-data-types.html#sect-data-formulas-references" title="5.2.4.3. Cell Referencing">Cell Referencing</a> for more details).
        But manually entering in cell ranges is slow and
        cumbersome. In order to speed up the entry of these cell
        ranges, the mouse and the keyboard arrow keys can be used to
        select these cell ranges quickly.
      </p><p>
        When editing a formula, if the cursor is at a point where a
        cell refrerence or range would be approrite, the reference or
        range can be selected using the mouse. If the mouse is used to
        click on a cell, the refrence of that cell will be entered
        into a formula. Alternatively, if the mouse is used to drag a
        selection over a range of cells, that cell range will become
        part of the formula. The selected range will be highlighted by
        a border of moving black dashes, commonly called the &quot;marching
        ants&quot; border.

          Begin entering a formula as you would normally. Stop at the

	</p></li><li><p>
	  Click on the cell you want to reference. Its reference will
	  be entered into the formula.

	</p></li></ol></div><p>The mouse can be used to select a single cell, a continous
    range of cells or several disjoint ranges of cells just like
    regular selections. </p><p>If entering lots of formulas or even just entering a few
    formulas, it is often quickest to use the keyboard to select cells
    and ranges of cells for use in formulas. Just as reaching a input
    point allows the user to select cells with the mouse, it is
    possible to use the keyboard to select cells. Just use the cursor
    keys and selection modifiers to create a selection.</p><div class="procedure"><p><b>Using the keyboard to enter cell references</b></p><ol type="1"><li><p>

      Errors are almost never entered directly into a spreadsheet but
      usually arise from problems which
      <b><tt>Gnumeric</tt></b> encounters during

    </p><p>
      In an unusual case where it is needed, an error can be entered
      by hand like the entry of other elements. First the cell must be
      selected, then the error must be entered (e.g. #DIV/0!) and
      finally the Enter key must be pressed.

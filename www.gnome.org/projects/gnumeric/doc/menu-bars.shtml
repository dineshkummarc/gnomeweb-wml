      The default location of the menubar is at the top of the
      application window.  The menus provide quick and organized access
      to all major commands such as opening files, saving files,
      printing and quitting the application.

      <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> menus are opened with a
      simple click on the name of the menu in the menu bar. Once
      clicked, the menu will stay open. If the mouse pointer is
      dragged over the name of another menu on the menubar, the first
      menu will close and the new menu open up. This is a useful way
      to look in each menu to hunt for a commands. Menus can also be
      opened through the keyboard. One of the letters in each menu is
      underlined. Typing the <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Alt</span> key at the same time
      as the underlined letter key will open the menu. This is also
      true of sub-menus. Once the menus are open, the arrow keys can
      be used to move between menus or select an entry in a particular
      menu. An open menu can be closed with a click over any other
      area of the application or of the desktop. The menus can also be
      closed by typing the escape key, <span class="keysym">Esc</span>.

      Many menu entries are followed by a series of keynames. These
      keys can be used to perform the menu action without having to
      open the menu.  These are often combinations of keys involving
      the control key which is labeled as <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Ctrl</span>, the
      shift key which is labeled <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Shift</span> and the
      function keys which are labeled with an <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">F</span> and
      then a number. For example, to quickly cut a selection
      (accessible through the <span class="guimenu" style="font-weight: bold; ">Edit</span> menu), the user
      can make a selection and then type the control key and the "x"
      key at the same time.

    scatterplots. Images in many standard computer formats can be
    added to a worksheet. Graphical user interface widgets can also be

    The various graphical elements which can be added to a
    <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> worksheet all behave in
    similar ways. The graphical elements all "float" above the cells
    in the cell grid and may obscure the contents of the cells
    behind, without affecting the contents of these hidden cells. All
    graphical elements are added in essentially the same way by
    selecting the element to add and then using the mouse, either with
    a simple click to place the element with a default size or with a
    click and drag to select the area of the worksheet to be covered
    by the element. These objects are moved or re-sized by clicking on
    the object with the primary mouse button and using the object
    body, border and "handles" (the small circles which appear at the
    corners and in the middle of each side) to manipulate the
    object. All of these objects will present a context menu through
    which to change the properties of the object, to save the object
    as an image, to change the stacking order (which graphical
    elements are in front of others), or to delete the object. Each of
    these operations will be summarized below and then explained in
    greater detail in the sections which follow.

      Many operations on graphical elements, including changing their

      stacking order of the elements, and deleting the elements, are
      performed through the context menu. The context menu appears
      when the mouse pointer is placed over the graphical element and
      one of the secondary mouse buttons is clicked. When the mouse
      pointer moves over a graphical element, it will change from the
      usual wide cross cursor to a right pointing arrow
      cursor. Clicking with the primary mouse button will select the
      graphical element but clicking with one of the other mouse
      buttons will open the context menu. The specific button that
      will trigger this menu depends on the specific hardware and
      configuration of the computer. By default it is usually the

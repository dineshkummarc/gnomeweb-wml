      Selections can be more complex than a single cell at a
      time. Selections may describe a continuous rectangular block of
      cells, an arbitrary shaped group of cells or even a discontinuous
      group of cells.

      The most common way to select a continuous rectangular block of
      cells uses a click and drag mouse motion. The cells in this
      continuous block can be selected by clicking and holding the left
      mouse button down on one of the corner cells (for instance, the
      top, leftmost cell) and dragging the mouse cursor to the
      opposite corner (for instance, the bottom, rightmost cell)
      before releasing. The selection box will expand to include all
      of the cells in this range.

      The most common way to select an arbitrary shaped or
      discontinuous group of cells is to hold down the
      <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Ctrl</span> key while using the mouse to select
      cells. As long as the <span class="keycap" style="font-weight: bold; ">Ctrl</span> key is held down,
      all of the cells included by a click or a click and drag motion
      will be added to the selection.

        odd shaped or discontinuous groups of cells.

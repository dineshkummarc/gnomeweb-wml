      The use of text format files to store and transmit data for use
      in a spreadsheet involves three somewhat complex decisions which
      determine how the file expresses and separates each data
      value. These complexities must be understood for a user to be
      able to use the <span class="interface" style="font-weight: bold; ">Text Import</span> druid
      effectively. These complexities exist because of the limitations
      of early computers and because or the historical development of
      computer systems by different manufacturers and programmers, in
      different countries, targeting different types of users,
      speaking different languages.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      The first complexity involves the different systems which relate
      the contents of a computer file to the characters in a written
      language. All text files on a computer consist of a long
      sequence of binary digits. Text files are files in which these
      digits are used to indicate different textual
      characters. Character 'encodings' are standardized systems which
      relate the binary digits in a computer file to a formal system
      of characters which includes both text glyphs (shapes) and
      formatting indicators. Each encoding defines a way to interpret
      the binary digits and uses the characters from a particular
      character set. The alternative character encoding strategies are
      explained in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="sect-file-textImport-complex.shtml#sect-file-textImport-complex-encoding" title="Character Encodings">Section 9.4.1.1 ― Character Encodings</a>, below.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      The second complexity involves the decision of how to separate
      the characters in a file into different lines. Text files
      explicitly determine the end of each line of a file with a
      specific character or sequence of characters. The complexity
      involves the particular character sequence used to determine the
      end of each line. Different conventions have been used in
      different computer systems. The alternative line breaking
      strategies are explained in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="sect-file-textImport-complex.shtml#sect-file-textImport-complex-lineBreak" title="Line break delimiters">Section 9.4.1.2 ― Line break delimiters</a>, below.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      The third complexity involves the decision of how to separate
      the characters in each line into separate value fields. Again,
      different strategies exist. These can be separated into two
      broad categories: strategies which use a character or sequence
      of characters to separate the values, so called 'delimited' or
      'separated' strategies, and strategies which use the position of
      the character in the line to separate the values, so called
      'fixed-width' strategies. The alternative data structuring
      strategies are explained in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="sect-file-textImport-complex.shtml#sect-file-textImport-complex-dataStruct" title="Data Structuring Strategies">Section 9.4.1.3 ― Data Structuring Strategies</a>, below.

      Fortunately, the <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> <span class="interface" style="font-weight: bold; ">Text Import</span> druid
      provides users with a way to preview the information in a text
      file. This enables users to change the settings which determine
      each of these three conventions until the text in the preview
      correctly shows the contents of the data file. Therefore, while
      the details of these three steps are complex, the practical
      impact on users is minimal. Users can simply experiment until
      the file appears correct without having to understand each of
      these complexities in detail.

      The use of text files to store data in a structured fashion for
      use by spreadsheet programs, and more generally all text files,
      require some scheme to relate the binary number in the computer
      file itself to the characters of a written language. Such
      schemes are called <span class="wordasword" style="font-style: italic; ">'encodings'</span>.

    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      The origin of computers led to the invention of a number of
      different encoding schemes. Due to the limitation of early
      computer hardware, these encoding schemes all restricted
      themselves to character sets which contained only the most
      essential characters of the English language. The desire to
      support characters which were not in this basic set of
      characters led to the creation of new encoding schemes,
      many of which restricted themselves to the characters in
      specific languages. One encoding scheme, called UTF-8, has now
      emerged as the best encoding scheme for the future for a
      multitude of reasons including its ability to co-exist with
      current operating systems and its ability to encode all of the
      characters in the largest set of characters which has been
      consistently defined, the Universal Character Set. However, the
      existence of the diversity of encoding schemes means that for
      the foreseeable future, files will be created and distributed
      using several different schemes. This is especially true for
      files containing text in languages other than English.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      This complex situation generally does not impact users.  <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span>
      has been designed to deal with most of the complexity. Many
      kinds of flies, such as the <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> file format itself, describe
      their encoding scheme internally in such a way that it can be
      easily recognized. <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> also provides an easy approach to
      changing the encoding scheme in case this proves necessary.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      Encoding schemes merely prove a hindrance to users when opening
      files. There is no danger that data be lost or that any other
      serious problem arise by selecting the wrong scheme. If the
      wrong scheme is selected, either the file will contain
      characters which are nonsensical and <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> will open an error
      dialog asking the user to select a different encoding scheme, or
      the preview area will display nonsensical characters. These
      nonsensical characters may simply be characters grouped
      together which do not occur in any language, such as
      "åÕÛÛÞ", or may be characters for which
      a graphical representation (a glyph) does not exist in the font
      being used and is therefore displayed using a small box with
      four numbers inside, such as  and . Each of
      these errors indicates that the encoding scheme used to read the
      file was not the same encoding scheme as was used to create the
      file. The difficulty is then to determine what encoding scheme
      to use. A simple process of trial and error should lead to
      picking the right scheme.

      A basic strategy to find the right encoding for a file being
      imported into <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> is, first, to use the scheme proposed by
      <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> and, then, to hunt for the correct encoding. The default
      encoding scheme is the one defined by the locale setting of the
      user and this is also the default scheme <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> uses to create
      text files.


      If the default encoding is incorrect, the correct encoding must
      be found by trial and error. One strategy to use is to examine
      the major western encodings and then the major regional
      encodings. The major western encoding schemes are ASCII,
      ISO-8859-1, and UTF-8, but ASCII is a subset of the other two so
      it does not need to be tried on its own. The major regional
      encodings are the IS0-8859-x schemes since these have become
      quite popular in GNU operating systems. Alternatively, the
      various character sets used by the Microsoft operating systems
      can be attempted. The encoding schemes are listed under
      "Western", "Unicode", and the alphabet names.

        The use of text files to store data in a structured fashion
        for use by spreadsheet programs requires a scheme to separate
        each line of the file. Structured text files rely on the files
        having explicitly defined rows within the file as one
        component in the structuring system. Each of these rows is
        defined by a character sequence indicating the end of a row.

       Two characters that are part of the ASCII code, an early
       encoding that became a widely followed standard, were included
       to help define the end of the line. These are the 'linefeed'
       character and the 'carriage return' character, named after the
       two processes which occur when a typewriter starts a new line:
       first the typewriter barrel rolls - the linefeed - then the
       whole carriage with the sheet of paper moves back to the
       starting point -the carriage return. In the same way that
       different computing systems have used different encoding
       schemes,  three different approaches became common for defining
       the end of the line.
     </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
       In GNU operating systems and other systems that inherit from
       the UNIX legacy, the end of a line was defined simply using the
       'linefeed' character. The Macintosh operating system chose
       instead to use only the 'carriage return' character. The
       Windows operating system uses both characters in the sequence
       'carriage return' then 'linefeed'.

       The use of text files to store data in a structured fashion for
       use by spreadsheet programs also requires some scheme to
       separate each value within every line. Two different approaches
       are used to separate these values. The first strategy, uses a
       particular character or character sequence to denote the start
       and end of each value. Such strategies are called 'Separated
       Value' or 'Delimited Value' systems. The second strategy places
       each value stating at a specified position in the line. Such
       strategies are called 'Fixed Width' strategies because they
       inherently require that each value have a pre-determined size.
     </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
       Separated Value structuring systems distinguish the contents of
       each value using pre-determined characters to separate the
       values. Certain characters have become common in such schemes,
       for-example 'Comma Separated Value' files use a comma character
       to separate values while 'Tab Separated Value' files use a tab
       character. <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> allows the user to define the value separator
       to be any one of several common characters or a specific
       sequence of characters, either on their own or in
       combination. For example, a file could use both space
       characters and tab characters to separate values. Similarly, a
       file could be read which used the entire word 'STOP' to separate
       values like the common scheme to separate sentences in a
       telegram.
     </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
       Separate Value structuring systems often also include a method
       to surround a single text value which may itself contain the
       character used to separate values. The quote character is often
       used in this role but <span class="application" style="font-style: italic; ">Gnumeric</span> allows users to configure any
       character in this role. For example, a file which used the
       comma to separate values could nonetheless contain a value like
       "Zoe, Sally, Dodji" if this value had appropriate text
       indicating characters at either end.
    </p><p xmlns:msg="http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/gnome-doc-utils/l10n" class="para">
      Fixed Width structuring systems are common formats for the
      output of database tables since the contents of these tables
      have often been defined as variables of a particular size.

      To import these files, users must specify exactly the start of
      each column so that the importer can separate the values on each
      row.

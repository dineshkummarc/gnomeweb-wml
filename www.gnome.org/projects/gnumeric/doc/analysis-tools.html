>The data analysis tools package contains various tools for
  statistical data analysis, random number generation and data
  sampling.  To use these tools select the ``Data Analysis...'' entry
  in the ``Tools'' menu.  This gives you a list of tools to choose
  from.  Select one of the tools from the list and press the OK
  button.  The tools are described below.</P
><P
>All the tools have the same output options.  The results can
  be printed out into a new sheet, into a new workbook, or into the
  same sheet within a given output range.  To select the output method
  just select one of the radio buttons bellow the ``Output options:''
  label.  Note that if the output is pasted into a range that is too
  small, some of the results will not fit in it.  Also not that the
  old data in the output range is lost.</P

NAME="ANOVA-SINGLE-FACTOR-TOOL"
>Anova: Single Factor Tool</A
></H2
><P
>Use this tool to make a single factor analysis of the
     variances of given variables. The variables are specified by the
     ``Input Range:'' entry.  The given range can be groupped either
     by columns or by rows.  ``Alpha:'' entry specifies the level of
     significance which is by default 95%.</P
><P
>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button on.  This leaves the first row (or the first
     column if the data is groupped by rows) of the input range out of
     the analysis.  In addition, the names of the variables are
     pasted nicely into the output table.</P
><P
>The tool calculates the source of variation between groups,
     within groups, and the total source of variation.  The values of
     these are given in the ''SS'' column.  The degrees of freedom of
     are given in the ''df'' column.  In ''MS'' column the sources of
     variation are divided by the degrees of freedom.  The results of
     these divisions are used in calculating the F value in the ''F''
     column.  The F value is the division of MS in ''Between columns''
     and ''MS'' in ''Within columns''.  You can compare this value
     with the ''F critical'' value in the last column.  The F critical
     value is the largest value of F that is statistically significant
     using the given significance level (''Alpha'').  Bellow the
     ''P-value'' is the result of the F-test.</P
><P
>In addition, the tool calculates the count, sum, average,
     and the variance of all the variables.</P

>For this tool, the given input range should contain at least
     two columns of numeric data and the labels of the columns and the
     labels of the groups.  The labels of the columns are given as the
     usual way; if you give an input range A1:D10, for example, the
     labels of the columns should be placed in B1, C1, and D1.  The 
     labels of the groups should be placed into the first column, each
     one of them at the first row of the group.  For example, if we have
     three groups in our A1:D10 range (rows per sample is set to three),
     the group names should be placed at A2, A5, and A8.</P

NAME="CORRELATION-TOOL"
>Correlation Tool</A
></H2
><P
>The correlation tool calculates correlation coefficients of
     given variables.  Use this tool to calculate any number of
     correlation coefficients at the same time.  The variables for
     which the correlations are calulated are specified by the ``Input
     Range:'' entry.  The given range can be groupped either by
     columns or by rows.</P
><P
>For example, you want to calculate the correlation between
     two variables, one in a column A and the other in a column B.
     Both variables have 10 values in rows between one and ten.  First
     you should enter A1:B10 to the ``Input Range:'' entry.  Secondly,
     select the ``Columns'' radio button next to the ``Groupped By:''
     label.  Then specify the output options described above and press
     the OK button.</P
><P
>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button on.  This leaves the first row (or the first
     column if the data is groupped by rows) of the input range out of
     the analysis.  In addition, the names of the variables are
     printed nicely into the output table.</P
><P
>The results are printed into a table where each column and
     row is labeled according to the names of the variables.  If the
     names are not given in the input range, Gnumeric generates them
     for you.  The calculated correlations are given in the table.
     For example, the correlation of the previous example, i.e,
     correlation between a variable in a column A and B, can be read
     in the second column and third row of the results table (bellow
     the column labeled ``Column 1'' and in the row labeled ``Column
     2'').</P

     at the same time.  The variables for which the covariances are
     calulated are specified by the ``Input Range:'' entry.  The given
     range can be groupped either by columns or by rows.</P
><P
>For example, you want to calculate the covarance of two
     variables, one in a column A and the other in a column B.  Both

NAME="DESCRIPTIVE-STATISTICS-TOOL"

></H2
><P
>The descriptive statistics tool calculates some statistical
     information of the given variables.  Use this tool to calculate
     general statistical measures and confidence levels for mean for
     any number variables at the same time.  The variables for which
     the statistical analysis is made are specified by the ``Input
     Range:'' entry.  The given range can be grouped either by
     columns or by rows.</P
><P
>This tool can produce four different kinds of statistical
     data.  The summary statistics is produced if the button
     ``Summary Statistics'' is checked on.  This tool calculates the
     mean, standard error, median, mode, standard deviation, sample
     variance, kurtosis, skewness, range, minimum, maximum, sum, and
     count for each given variable.</P
><P
>If ``Confidence Interval for the Mean'' button is checked on, the
     tool calculates  confidence intervals for the mean of each variable.
     You should specify the confidence level in the entry
     box.  The default value is to calculate the confidence level of
     95%. Note that the interval given will usually be wider than the 
     interval obtained using the CONFIDENCE functionn since that function
     assumes that the population standard deviation is known while this tool
     estimates the population standard deviation by the sample standard
     deviation.</P
><P
>If ``Kth Largest:'' button is checked on, the tool finds
     the kth largest value of each of the variables.  Specify the k in
     the entry box next to the check button.</P
><P
>If ``Kth Smallest:'' button is checked on, the tool finds
     the kth smallest value of each of the variables.  Specify the k in
     the entry box next to the check button.</P
><P
>If you have labels, for example the names of the variables,
     in the first row (or column) of the given range, you should check the
     ``Labels'' button.  This leaves the first row (or column)  of
     the input range out of the analysis.  In addition, the names of
     the variables are printed in the output table.</P

     first variable are specified in the ``Variable 1 Range:'' entry.
     Correspondingly, the values of the second variable are given in
     the ``Variable 2 Range:'' entry.  ``Alpha:'' entry specifies the

><P
>The results are given in a table.  The tool calculates and
     prints the mean, variance, count of observations and the degree
     of freedom for both variables.  It also calculates the F-value,
     the one-tailed probability for the F-value, and the F Critical
     value for one-tailed test.  The one-tailed probability for the
     F-value (``P(F&#60;=f) one-tail'' row) describes the risk of making a
     Type I error of one-tailed test.</P

     probability distributions.</P
><P
>To use this tool, first specify the number of variables in
     the ``Number of Variables:'' entry box.  This determines the
     number of columns of random values to be produced.  Secondly,
     specify the number of random numbers.  This determines the number
     of rows of random values to be produced.  Thirdly specify the
     random distribution by selecting one of the list items from the
     random distribution list.  The following random distributions are
     supported: Discrete, Normal, Bernoulli, and Uniform.  Then
     specify the parameters of the distribution.</P

><P
>For Discrete random distribution, specify the value and
	probability input range in the ``Value and Probability Input
	Range:'' entry box.  That is a table consisting of two columns
	and any number of rows.  The first column specifies the
	discrete random values and the second column the probabilities
	for them.  The discrete random values do not have to be
	numbers, for example, strings will do as well.  The sum of the
	probabilities in the second column should be one.  For
	example, if you have the values A, B, C, and D in A1:A4 and
	values 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.3 in B1:B4, you could specify
	value and probability input range to be A1:B4.</P
><P
>For Normal random distribution, specify the mean and the
	standard deviation.  The default values for them are 0 for
	mean and 1 for standard deviation.</P
><P
>For Bernoulli random distribution, specify the ``p
        Value''.  This is a probability value between 0 and 1.
        Bernoulli distribution has two random values 0 and 1, and the
        ``p Value'' specifies the probability of value 1.  The mean of
        a random variable that has a Bernoulli distribution is E(X) =
        1(p) + 0(1-p) = p, and the variance is var(X) = p(1-p).</P
><P
>For Uniform random distribution, specify the range of
        the random variables by filling the ``Between:'' and ``And:''
        entries.  The default values for them are 0 and 1 that gives
        random numbers between zero and one.</P

     taken to the sample.</P
><P
>To use this tool, first specify the data set by setting the
     ``Input Range:'' entry.  Then select the sampling method which
     can be either periodic or random.  Periodic sampling requires
     that you specify the period by typing a number to the ``Period:''
     entry.  For example, if you specify the period to be three then
     you will get a sample that has every third value of the original
     data set.  Random sampling requires that you specify the size of
     the random sample in ``Number of Samples:'' entry.  The size
     cannot be larger than the original data set since each value of
     the original data set is taken at most once to the sample.</P

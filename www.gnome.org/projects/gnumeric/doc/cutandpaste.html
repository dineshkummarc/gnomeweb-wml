>A second set of choices allows the user to perform simple
      mathematical operations during the paste. These operations
      use the current contents of the cells in the paste range and the
      contents of the clipboard. For example, if you are pasting a
      cell containing number 5 to a cell that currently contains
      number 10 and choose option <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"

>, the
      result will be 10/5=2. Choosing option <SPAN

><LI

> <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Transpose</SPAN

	    will transpose the selection, i.e.  interchange the rows
	    and columns. Thus, a range with k rows and n columns will
	    become a range with n rows and k columns, so that the firs
	    row becomes the first column, and so on.
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Skip Blanks</SPAN

	    prevents <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</SPAN
> from taking
	    any action for the cells in the selection that are
	    blank. For such cells, the existing  contents of the cells
	    in the paste range will be kept.

      with middle mouse button (if you have two button mouse, you can
      emulate middle mouse by pressing left and right buttons

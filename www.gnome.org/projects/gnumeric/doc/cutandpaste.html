      cell containing number 5 to a cell that currently contains
      number 10 and choose option <TT

><UL
><LI

CLASS="GUILABEL"

	    will transpose the selection, i.e.  interchange the rows
	    and columns. Thus, a range with k rows and n columns will
	    become a range with n rows and k columns, so that the firs
	    row becomes the first column, and so on.

	    prevents <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Gnumeric</TT

	    any action for the cells in the selection that are
	    blank. For such cells, the existing  contents of the cells
	    in the paste range will be kept.

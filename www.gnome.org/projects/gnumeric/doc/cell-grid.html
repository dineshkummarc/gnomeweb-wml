	cell grid area, the column and row headers on the top and left, the
	scrollbars on the right and bottom and the tab list at the very bottom.

> The figure has a few and shows that cell B3 as being 
	selected. In this figure, the columns and rows have been 
	resized and therefore look uneven. </P
><P
>Each cell in this area is delimited by a light grey line by default.
	The current selection is indicated by a rectangular box with a little box
	on the lower right, this case cell J12. The view in this figure shows the
	middle portion of a worksheet which is evident in two ways. Firstly, the
	column and row headers do not start at column A and row 1. Secondly, the
	scroll thumbs are not at the top and left. The thumbs are the boxes within
	the scroll bars that are used to scroll. Note also that cell D19 has a
	comment within it which is shown by the little red triangle at the top
	right corner.</P
><P
>The size of a cell is determined by the
	width of the column and height of the row that the cell is in. The columns and rows
	can be resized by acting on the header relevant to the cell. The user must move the 
	mouse pointer to the edge of the header which is either to the right or below the cell. 
	With the mouse pointer in this position, the pointer will change to a set of opposite 
	pointing arrows. The user must then drag this edge away from the top left corner. This 
	takes a little practice.</P
><P
>The cell area is the core of Gnumeric. Therefore the maual explains the use of 
	cells in much greater detail in a separate section. Interested users should read

>, Gnumeric has a tabbed sheet 
	  indicator. This is the boxes with the labels "Guppies", "Turtles", "Mermaids", 
	  "seahorses" and so on. In workbooks where there are more than one sheet, extra 
	  tabs are used to indicate how many sheets are there, and also allows the user to move 
	  to another sheet by clicking the proper tab. Each 
	  tab is a link to a separte worksheet within Gnumeric. In this figure, the "Turtles" tab 
	  has been selected. Gnumeric shows this by making the "Turtles" since the tab is a 
	  little bigger and making it overlap the two neighbouring tabs.</P
><P
>On the far
	  right, the two arrows indicate that there are more sheets in the workbook
	  and more tabs for those sheets. Unfortunately, there is not enough space
	  to show them all so Gnumeric displays these arrows. If all the sheets are
	  visible, these arrows will not be displayed. These arrows can be used to
	  scroll the tabs and bring tabs that were hidden into view. This may be a
	  little difficult to understand and work with but becomes easier quickly.</P

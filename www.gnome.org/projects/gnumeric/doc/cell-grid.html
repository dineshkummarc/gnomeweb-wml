The Cell Grid</h2></div></div><p>Most of the work done on a spreadsheet is done to the main
    Cell area, the large grid like part of the worksheet. This is
    where all the formulas and data are entered, and is the center of
    activity for the spreadsheet.</p><div class="figure"><p><a name="cell-grid.png"></a><b>Figure 4.24. The Cell Grid area, with cells of different sizes.</b></p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/cell-grid.png" alt="An image of the cell grid area."></div></div></div><p><a href="cell-grid.html#cell-grid.png" title="Figure 4.24. The Cell Grid area, with cells of different sizes.">Figure 4.24</a> shows the the cell grid
 	area, the column and row headers on the top and left, the
 	scrollbars on the right and bottom and the tab list at the
 	very bottom.
	</p><p> The figure has a few and shows that cell B3 as being 
	selected. In this figure, the columns and rows have been 
	resized and therefore look uneven. </p><p>Each cell in this area is delimited by a light grey line
	by default.  The current selection is indicated by a
	rectangular box with a little box on the lower right, this
	case cell J12. The view in this figure shows the middle
	portion of a worksheet which is evident in two ways. Firstly,
	the column and row headers do not start at column A and row
	1. Secondly, the scroll thumbs are not at the top and
	left. The thumbs are the boxes within the scroll bars that are
	used to scroll. Note also that cell D19 has a comment within
	it which is shown by the little red triangle at the top right
	corner.</p><p>The size of a cell is determined by the width of the
	column and height of the row that the cell is in. The columns
	and rows can be resized by acting on the header relevant to
	the cell. The user must move the mouse pointer to the edge of
	the header which is either to the right or below the cell.
	With the mouse pointer in this position, the pointer will
	change to a set of opposite pointing arrows. The user must
	then drag this edge away from the top left corner. This takes
	a little practice.</p><p>The cell area is the core of Gnumeric. Therefore the
	maual explains the use of cells in much greater detail in a
	separate section. Interested users should read <a href="chapter-data.html" title="Chapter 5. Working with Data">Chapter 5</a>.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="col-row-headers"></a>4.18.1. The Column and Row Headers.</h3></div></div><p>
      The sheet is bordered by column headers on the top and row
      headers to the left.  Columns are labeled alphabetically running
      horizontally across the top of the sheet as shown in <a href="cell-grid.html#worksheet-cols-1" title="Figure 4.25. The column labels at the top of the worksheet.">Figure 4.25</a>.

    Rows are labeled along the left side of the worksheet. Each label
    is a differrent integer increasing downward. This is shown in
    <a href="cell-grid.html#worksheet-rows-1" title="Figure 4.26. The row labels at the left side of the worksheet.">Figure 4.26</a>.

		The cell grid area's scrollbars work like other
		scrollbars. In this case they let the user work on a
		worksheet which is much bigger than what could be
		shown at any given moment.
		</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2858950"></a>4.18.3. The Tabbed Sheet Indicator</h3></div></div><p>At the bottom of
      <a href="cell-grid.html#cell-grid.png" title="Figure 4.24. The Cell Grid area, with cells of different sizes.">Figure 4.24</a>, Gnumeric has a tabbed sheet
      indicator. This is the boxes with the labels "Guppies",
      "Turtles", "Mermaids", "seahorses" and so on. In workbooks where
      there are more than one sheet, extra tabs are used to indicate
      how many sheets are there, and also allows the user to move to
      another sheet by clicking the proper tab. Each tab is a link to
      a separte worksheet within Gnumeric. In this figure, the
      "Turtles" tab has been selected. Gnumeric shows this by making
      the "Turtles" since the tab is a little bigger and making it
      overlap the two neighbouring tabs.</p><p>On the far right, the two arrows indicate that there
	  are more sheets in the workbook and more tabs for those
	  sheets. Unfortunately, there is not enough space to show
	  them all so Gnumeric displays these arrows. If all the
	  sheets are visible, these arrows will not be
	  displayed. These arrows can be used to scroll the tabs and
	  bring tabs that were hidden into view. This may be a little
	  difficult to understand and work with but becomes easier
	  quickly.</p></div></div><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/transitional" class="navfooter"><hr></hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="data-entry.html">&lt;&lt;&lt; Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="info-area.html">Next &gt;&gt;&gt;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left">4.17.

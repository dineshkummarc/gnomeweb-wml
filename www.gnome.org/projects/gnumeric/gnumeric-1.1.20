Gnumeric 1.1.20 aka 'Dryden Mar 7 1995 - Aug 20 2003, he was cuddly' is now available.

    This release of GNOME's spreadsheet is _huge_.  We've spent the last 2
    months squashing bugs, getting the docs in shape, and polishing up the text
    importer.  Trying to summarise the NEWS entries is daunting.

    Gnumeric-1.1 is now in beta mode.  We'll be doing weekly releases until
    1.2.0 comes out hopefully on Sept 8.  This includes a string freeze
    everywhere accept the charting engine.  The charts are now somewhat useful,
    Emmanuel contributed ring, line and area plot support, Jean greased up the
    gradients, and I tacked on patterns.  There are still some rough edges but
    you can get real work done now.

    We also hit a major milestone.  All of the worksheet functions in the US
    version of MS Excel are now supported.  The text importer has now been
    cleanup, and should address all of the common requests for the 1.0.x version.

    NOTE : Package this release.  It is stable enough for general deployment
	and use, for all intents and purposes 1.1.x is now at least as
	stable as 1.0 (we hope)

    NOTE : http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120102

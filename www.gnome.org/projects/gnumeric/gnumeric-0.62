Gnumeric 0.62 aka 'stork attack' is now available.  I currently consider
this a development release.  It has a number of important fixes from 0.61 but
it also includes a fair amount of new code.  If after one week things seem as
stable as our testing suggested for the next week I'll upgrade the status.

This version of Gnumeric includes the first of 3 steps designed to improve
performance and scalability.  We can now comfortably load 1M cells onto a Ppro200
with 128Meg.  It also includes some initial steps towards improving support for
plugins.

PACKAGERS BE CAREFUL!  The structure of the plugin directories has changed.

NOTE : Please do not package or submit bug reports for gnumeric-bonobo.  Bonobo
       has been frozen for GNOME 1.4 but has not yet become part of the
       official platform.  It is fairly stable but not yet the default build.

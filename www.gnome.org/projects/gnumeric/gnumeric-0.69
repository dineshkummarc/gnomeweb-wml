Gnumeric 0.69 aka 'diaper duty' is now available.

This is primarily a bug fix release.  A few new features have been added,
including a Psion importer.  A couple of the core features added in recent
releases have been completed.  Frozen panes and outline mode are now fully
functional, with full XL import/export.  Andreas has been very helpful in
reviewing some of the statistical code.  Most of the remaining elements in this
release are characterisable as behaviour polishing.  It should be very stable as
we run up to 1.0.   As mentioned the feature freeze date of July has obviously
slipped and is now targeted at August.  Work on graphs starting with XL import
is progressing and should be in the next release.

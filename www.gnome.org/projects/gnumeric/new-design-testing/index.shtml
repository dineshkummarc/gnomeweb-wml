      <h1>Welcome to Gnumeric!</h1>
      <p>The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the <a
      href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> desktop environment: a
project to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.</p> 
      <a href="images/gnumeric-sample.png"><img id="sampleimage" src="images/gnumeric-sample-thumb.png" alt="Gnumeric Example" /></a>

      <h2>Gnumeric is...</h2>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>Fast!</strong>  Gnumeric handles large spreadsheets
	while remaining responsive.
	<li><strong>Cheap!</strong>  Gnumeric is available free of charge,
	licensed under the terms of the
	<a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnumeric/COPYING">GNU
	General Public License</a>.
	<li><strong>Accurate!</strong>  Unlike all other spreadsheets
	on the market, Gnumeric's built-in functions and tools are
	accurate.
      </ul>

      <h2>Migration</h2>
      <p>Gnumeric is intended to be a drop in replacement for proprietary
spreadsheets. We are not attempting to clone existing applications.
However, we offer a customizable feel that attempts to minimize the costs
of transition.</p>
      <p>Gnumeric will import your existing Excel, 1-2-3, Applix, Sylk, XBase
Quattro Pro, Dif, Plan Perfect, and Oleo files. If you are a developer and you
want to contribute new importers (or polishing and perfect existing importers)
we welcome your patches.  We are also looking for test cases for the various
formats, non coders who can produce comprehensive sample workbooks so that we
can validate the importers would also be appreciated.</p>

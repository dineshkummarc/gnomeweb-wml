Gnumeric 1.1.7 aka '11x3 + 1' is now available.

    This release some nice new functions, Jukka Pekka has been busy.  We're
    well past Excel in spots and he's gunning for @RISK.  I've tacked on few
    frequently requested UI improvements (eg double click to edit).  The import
    export routines have also seen a fair amount of work.  Excel export is
    improved, it is significantly faster and uses less memory.  It even fixes
    the column resizing bug (thanks Keelyn).  Excel import is beginning to
    support external links, and I've thrown in a handler for polygon objects so
    that we can support those nifty map pieces MS likes to stick in their
    workbooks.  Plan Perfect import is working again and our newly supplied WK1
    tests load better now that we have some function mapping.  Zbigniew has
    returned and is banging at enhancing the plugin system.  Morten and I have
    been busy checking ever larger test sets for leaks, and plugging them.
    Grandma Chema also stopped by to get a few nifty bugs fixed.

    NOTE : We have disabled building 1.1 using gcc-2.96.  There are a few known
       areas where the compiler shipped with RH/Mandrake was causing numeric
       inaccuracies in Gnumeric.  If you don't mind that feel free to manually
       remove the prohibition.

    NOTE : Although this is a development release it should be quite stable.
      There are is still feature regressions from 1.0 (porting graphs to gtk2)
      but other than that this release should be usable.  Please play with it.

Jody:
	* Fix and speed up the XL exporter.
	* Make the behavior for right button consistent in all contexts.
	* Fix import of frozen panes.
	* Fix XL export of functions with fewer args than XL requires
	* Improve the wk1 importer
	* Implement some of Harlan's CELL routines to help the wk1 importer
	* Make sheet deletion multi-view safe.
	* More fixes for named expressions.
	* Remove old bogosity when importing the err form of #REF!
	* Fix handling of embedded newlines for gtk2
	* Fix Chema's bug.
	* Don't leak clipboard on exit.
	* Have Enter move the edit_pos while in the editline the same way it
	  does in the cell.
	* Support Double click in cell to start editing.
	* Change the cursor when the mouse is in the edit item.
	* Improve (Fix?) colwidth exporting in xls

	* Ultra basic support for Excel 95 Polygon objects.
	* Fix color leak with grid color change, and small warning.

Jukka:
	* New random distribution functions (mostly integrated from the 
	  GNU Scientific Library with some minor modifications):
	  RANDDISCRETE(), RANDGAUSSIANTAIL() and RANDLANDAU().
	* New random distributions for the random number generation tool:
	  Gaussian Tail, Landau, and Uniform integer.
	* New financial function, VDB(), integrated from the OpenOffice
	  with some modifications and clean up.
	* New statistical functions (integrated from the R 1.5.1 and
	  GSL 1.1.1):
	  BERNOULLI(), CAUCHY(), EXPPOWDIST(), GEOMDIST(), LANDAU(),
 	  LAPLACE(), LOGISTIC(), PARETO(), RAYLEIGH(), and RAYLEIGHTAIL().

	  `Insert->Function' dialog.
	* Function documentation improvements.
	* Implemented standard errors output for the exponential
          smoothing tool.

	* Implemented SIMTABLE() function related to the risk simulation
	  tool.
	* Initial EUROCONVERT() function.

Morten:
	* Fix random number generator to really use /dev/urandom.

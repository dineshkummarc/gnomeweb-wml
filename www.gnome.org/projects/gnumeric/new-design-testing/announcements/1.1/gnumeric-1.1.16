Gnumeric 1.1.16 aka 'L M L W' is now available.

    A few long awaited improvements to the internals have finally landed.  This
    includes full support for Ms Excel's 1904 date convention.  If you don't
    know what it is consider yourself lucky.  Jon Kåre stepped up and finished
    off the hyper-link dialog which makes that feature useful.  There was also a
    fair amount of testing for the xls exporter.  We can definitely handle
    files larger than 6.8Meg now (something gnumeric-1.0.x & libole2 could not).
    Also, at Daniel's behest our new xml import utilities can correctly handle
    namespaces, enough that a quick test wrapper for Ms Excel XP's xml format
    was simple.  Oddly, I actually prefer Excel's xml to OpenOffice.

    NOTE : Although this is a development release it should be quite
      stable.  There are is still feature regressions from 1.0
      (porting graphs to gtk2) but other than that this release should
      be usable.  Please play with it.

    NOTE : This release now relies on gnome-print-2.2.x

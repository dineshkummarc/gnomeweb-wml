Gnumeric 0.58 aka 'Grandma rides again' has been released.  This version was
supposed to be for pure development.  Boy was I WRONG!  Some of our testers
(especially Grandma Chema) went to town, reporting over 40 bugs of
varying magnitudes.  Coupled with reports from the rest of the
community this turned into a massive drive to stability.  The score
so far :
    - 3 crashes fixed
    - 22 display errors fixed
    - 9 features fixed
    - 1 import bug fixed (for locales other than C)

It is strongly recommended that people upgrade.
NOTE : we depend on at least GAL 0.2.2 to fix a critical bug
       we depend on gnome-print 0.25 to fix a display problem

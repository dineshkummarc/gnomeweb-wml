Hey guys!

   This is the release of Gnumeric "Simplified Bonobo" 0.14.

   The only difference between Gnumeric 0.13 and 0.14 is that 0.14
ships in a way that makes the install process use the documentation as
it was generated in my machine (that means, you do not need the
Docbook tools installed in your system to get the documentation).

Best wishes,
miguel.

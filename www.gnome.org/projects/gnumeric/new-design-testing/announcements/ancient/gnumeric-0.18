Hello guys,

   New gnumeric is out.

   This is mainly a bug fix release

* Features:

	- More functions from Michael Meeks

	- Bug fix: Applying a cell number format should work again inmediately
	  (it was not queuing the re-rendering operation).

	- Bug fix: Precedence fixes: when decoding the tree to render a text
	  representation, I was not properly considering the case for
	  same-priority but different meaning operations. 

	  Should work now. (ie, it will correctly decode 1/(c4*d4)
	  again. 

	- New code: integer overflow/underflow detection code.  Now
	  addition and substraction will be promoted to floating point
	  values if there is a overflow in the computation.

Gnumeric 0.25 has been released

Hello guys,

Gnumeric 0.25 has been released.  Lots of new things are happening
in this new version, here is a list:

* User visible

* New functions: BETADIST(), FDIST(), TDIST(), CHIDIST(),
CHIINV(), GAMMAINV(), GAMMADIST() from Jukka-Pekka.

* New functions: SUMSQ(), MULTINOMIAL(), PRODUCT(), SQRTPI().
I believe these are from Jukka Pekka, but I do not see a
ChangeLog entry.

* Enhanced Excel importing code even more (Michael Meeks).

* Goal seek dialog box from Jukka-Pekka works.

* Round up bug fixed by Morten Welinder.

* Recomputation bugs for cell ranges fixed (some taxpayers
noticed that their loaded sheets were not recalculating at
startup, thanks for their input).

* User visible, not ready

* More Bonobo work.  Start of graphics wizard for use with
Guppi, the GNOME plotting engine.


* Foundation work

* Integration of libglade into Gnumeric.  Now we can design
our dialog boxes with Glade and use libglade to load the
GUIs.  Thanks to Damon Chaplin for Glade and James
Henstridge for libglade and his support with libglade.

* Made the code use 'const' a lot more (Morten Welinder), this
helps making the code more robust.

* Not very visible

* Assorted batch of bug fixes.

* A number of memory leaks have been fixed (Morten Welinder).

* Excel loader can even restore your selection :-) (Michael
Meeks).

* A number of sanity checks from Morten Welinder.

Miguel.

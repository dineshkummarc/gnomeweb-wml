Hello guys,

   Gnumeric 0.47 has been released.

   This is mostly a bug fix release, we have been fixing a bunch of
errors that had been queued on our personal lists and on the bug
tracking system as well as some obvious flops from 0.46.

* Availability:

  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnumeric/gnumeric-0.47.tar.gz

* New in this release:

	* Paste from X applications to Gnumeric should work again (it
	  was shortly broken) (Miguel).

	* Printing should pick a better bounding box (Michael)

	* Paste from X applications to Gnumeric will actually do the
	  right cell splitting and bounding computation in the presence of
	  cell-separators (Miguel)

	* Import plugins should work now (Jody).

	* Memory leak fixes to the parser for array formulas (Miguel)

	* Entering data into the spreadsheet should not cancel the
	  paste buffer (Miguel).

	* Guile plugin bug fixed (Michael)

	* A serious recomputation bug has been fixed (in some
	  conditions it would make gnumeric loop infinitely) (Michael). 

	* Should load properly sheets that had empty values (this
	  causes some cells to display nothing but be considered to
	  have an empty string, thus breaking computation for any
	  refence to those) (Jody, Miguel).

	* CORBA command context are implemented (Miguel).
	
Enjoy,
Miguel

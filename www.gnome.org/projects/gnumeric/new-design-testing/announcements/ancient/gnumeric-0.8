Hello guys,

   Gnumeric "International Manatee" 0.8 has been released.

   This version is available in:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric-0.8.tar.gz

   The most important change in International Manatee is the fact that
the documentation that Adrian Likins wrote is now integrated into the
build system.  It gets installed and we feature a reference guide for
the internal Gnumeric functions. 

   These are the features of International Manatee:

	- Bruno enabled the coloring page for setting the foreground
	  color. 

	- The sheet label name works properly now (it no longer
	  "slides"). 

	- Correct behaviour of clicking in the presence of editing the
	  sheet label name.

	- Guile support now needs to be explicitly configure
	  (--with-guile).
	
	- Fix crashing problems repoted when autofilling.

	- Documentation is included in the tarball (You need DocBook
	  if you plan on extending the documentation or fixing my
	  ugly, ugly, ugly stuff :-).  You can find Docbook here:

		ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/home/rosalia/docware.
	
	  A docbook tutorial is available in:

		http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro.html

	  The full docbook documentation can be downloaded for free
	  from the Davenport site (I lost the url to this, but I am 
	  confident all of you documentation-savvy people are good
	  at altavistaing things).

Enjoy,
Miguel.

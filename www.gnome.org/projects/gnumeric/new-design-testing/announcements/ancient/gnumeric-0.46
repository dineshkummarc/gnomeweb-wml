Hello guys,

   A new version of Gnumeric has been released

* Availability:

  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnumeric/gnumeric-0.46.tar.gz

* New in this release:

    - Greatly enhanced Excel Export, it now handles styles, and summaries are
      now mostly complete (Jody, Jon, Michael)
  
    - Linear regression and linear optimization were added.

    - Many improvments for plugins.  The guile plugin is seeing active
      development and many of the dormant modules are now enabled by default.

    - Some final Y2K polishing has also been done.
	Guessing dates correctly when you enter them (Peter Moulder)

    - Lots of core adjustments and stability improvements.

	* The beginning of a command interface for implementing error
	  reporting and setting up the Undo architecture (Jody).

	* Make the interface more consistent in a few places (JP)

	* Cell sort user interface improved (JP)

	* Handles failed file/open and file/import better (Jody)

	* Improved error reporting mechanism for Plugins (Jody).

    - Functions

	* New EURO() function for currency conversions (Jukka-Pekka)

	* Few skeleton functions added

	* Robustify range checking in a few functions (Morten)

	* Improved statistical functions, regression code works with
	  multi-dimensional data (check ChangeLog for details) (Andrew)

    - Printing should be smarter

	It should no longer print out the entire sheet, but try to
	find the best region to print (JP, Michael)

    - Python plugin should work now (Jody)

    - More user-visible state is preserved on the .gnumeric files (Michael)

    - Various bugs were fixed and memory leaks were plugged as usual.

    - Updated Gnumeric programming documentation.

    - Filters

      Fixed HTML export (michael), 

* Installation Notes :
    
    1) Be sure to install the plugins supplied with this release.
       Previous versions will neither work, nor be accepted.

    2) You will want to clear out ~/.gnome/Gnumeric if you had used
       the printing code in other versions, this will speed up
       Gnumeric (a bug was there that could slow Gnumeric down).

* Contributors to this release:

  Andrew Chatman, Ariel Rios, Cort Dougan, Ettore Perazzoli, Frank,
  Jody Goldberg, Jon K Hellan, Michael Meeks, Joe Sakosky, JP Rosevar,
  Jukka-Pekka Iivonnen, Kjartan Maaras, Miguel de Icaza, Morten
  Welinder, Peter Moulder, Tuomas Kuosmanen, and Yuri Syrota.

Enjoy,
Miguel.

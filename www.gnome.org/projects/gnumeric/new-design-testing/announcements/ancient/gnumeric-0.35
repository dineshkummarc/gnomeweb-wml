Hello,

   Ok, by popular demand, there is a new Gnumeric release: 
Gnumeric "Uncrashable during column resize" 0.35.  

* Availability:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric

   New features in this release:

* Uncrahable magic

	* Should not crash on column resizing.

	* Should terminate properly the strings that get saved
	  (Morten, thanks, btw)

* Format fixing

	* "\" format character is an escape sequence, and should work
	  on this release

* Memory leak plugs

	* Morten as usual tracked down a bunch of memory leaks and
	  they are now plugged.  Thanks Morten!

* Bonobo-land

	* Michael added Bonobo drag-and-drop support to Gnumeric.  It
	  will only work if you have Bonobo installed (not recomended
	  for regular operation).

	* Michael also fixed the destruction of objects (for the
	  Bonobo case).

* Others

	* Cursor loading fixed (Morten).

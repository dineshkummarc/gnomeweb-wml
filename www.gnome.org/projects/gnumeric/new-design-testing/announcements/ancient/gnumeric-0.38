Hello Gnumeric fans!

   I have release a new version of Gnumeric 0.38.  This version is
basically a bug fix release.  We did fix so many things in the last
day, that it was worth making a new release of the code.

   This version of Gnumeric needs gnome-print 0.8 (just released) as I
corrected a printing semantic error in both programs.

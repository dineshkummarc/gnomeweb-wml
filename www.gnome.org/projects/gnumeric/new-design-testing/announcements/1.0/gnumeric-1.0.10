Gnumeric 1.0.10 'Yayyyyy Keelyn!' is now available.

    This is a medium priority bug fix release, new development is being
    done in version 1.1.x based on gnome2.

    There are a collection of fixes for the excel exporter, named
    expressions, and repeated cols/rows when printing.  It also has some
    forward compatibility additions to facilitate communication with the
    development version.

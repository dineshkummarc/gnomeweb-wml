Gnumeric 1.0.11 'Ray Ray Ray your boat' is now available.

    This is a medium priority bug fix release, new development is being
    done in version 1.1.x based on gnome2.

    The main change in this release is that Ray Dassen has stepped up to become
    the maintainer of the 1.0.x tree.  He's done the heavy lifting to get
    Gnumeric happy under newer versions of the auto* tools.  There is also a
    fairly important fix for xml importing files with non ASCII characters.

<h2>How can I help?</h2>
<p>Thank you for wanting to pitch in to help Gnumeric grow!  There are many
ways to help, some of which are outlined below.  We have all sorts of different
projects, ranging from the small to the huge.  Most likely you'll want to get
more familiar with the people behind Gnumeric and get comfortable with how
things are done.  We can help point you to the project that interests you, or
maybe we'll help you find a small little project to help you get started.</p>


<h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>
<p>If Gnumeric is not functioning right we need to know!  The way to tell us is
to <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric>report a
bug</a>.  A good bug report is one that...</p>
<ul>
<li>Specified the what version of Gnumeric is causing a problem.</li>
<li>Tells us precisely what formulas to enter into which cells.  One way to do
this is to attach a sample sheet that shows the problem.</li>
<li>Tells us exactly what you think is wrong.
    <ul>
    <li>For evaluation problems something like "<em>cell A2 shows the value 3,
    but it should show 4</em>" is good.</li>
    <li>For graph problems attaching a screenshot might be a good idea.</li>
    <li>For compilation problems copying the command that fails and the error
    from it is good.  Adding information about your compiler version is even
    better.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Includes any error messages that are printed by Gnumeric.</li>
<li>For crashes, a stack trace is generally very useful.</li>
<li>Includes a working return email address.</li>
</ul>

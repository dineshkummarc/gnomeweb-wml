This document describes the parts of a page so that it's clear what
  does what, and how to make this crazy thing do what you need it to
  when you add a page.

This will be written tomorrow [may 17th 2004], after I've split off the
  presentation information from the individual page contents.  I.e.
  *I* have to figure out how the heck to make this crazy thing do what
  we need it to do. ;)

I know it's gonna use SSI.  That much is known.

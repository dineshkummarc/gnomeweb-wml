<h1>Things we plan to do in Gnumeric</h2>
<p>These are our immediate (and not-so-immediate) plans for new features or
just work to be done in Gnumeric.  Feel free to <a
href="contact-info.shtml">contact us</a> if you want to help or just discuss
any of these.</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/gnumeric/BUGS">developers'
scratch pad</a> is usually up to date, but may not spell things out in
details.</p>

<h2>Immediate plans</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Stabilize, stabilize, stabilize!</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Intermediate plans</h3>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Format engine rewrite.</b> Our current number formatting and matching
  engines are based directly on Excel format strings.  That is truly
  sub-optimal and needs to be rewritten in terms of sensible objects.</li>
  <li><b>Function documentation.</b>  Currently the documentation for functions
  like SUM, VAR, and so on is one large string per function.  That makes life
  hard on translators and invites large amounts of duplication.</li>
  </ol>
<h2>Wish-list (long-range plans)</h3>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Pivot tables.</b>  This is probably just a matter of time and
  effort.</li>
  </ol>

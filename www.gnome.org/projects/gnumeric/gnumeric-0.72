Gnumeric 0.72 aka 'oooh yummy eye candy' is now available.

    This is primarily a bug fixes as we prepare for a production ready release
    before the end of the year.  Graphs require Guppi 0.40.0.  In addition to
    the plethora is small improvements we threw in a few extras thrown in to
    make it fun.  Morten's improved search console is very nice, and thanks to
    Andreas range selection and non-modal dialogs are now outnumber the old
    ones.  We now support auto-scrolling during object creation which makes all
    mouse actions auto-scrollable.

    Chema and his army of evil monkeys has been kicking the tires trying to
    make things fail.  Please give him a hand and kick the tires.  We always
    prefer to find the bugs BEFORE we release :-)

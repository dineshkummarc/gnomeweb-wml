      <p><h1>Future Plans and Technologies</h1></p>
Have a look in BUGS and TODO for the details.  A wide selection of projects of
varying degrees of difficult are available for anyone who is interested.
Introduce yourself on the mailing list and we'll find something that interests
you.

<p><h2>CORBA, compound documents</h2></p>

As part of the GNOME desktop, Gnumeric uses the <a
HREF="http://cvs.labs.redhat.com/ORBit">ORBit</a> CORBA implementation
to expose its services to the world.  This means that you can remotely
control Gnumeric from any language that has CORBA bindings for it.
Recently Owen Taylor's <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/corba/orbit.html">Perl bindings
for CORBA/ORBit</a> has caused a great deal of interest for
controlling Gnumeric remotely.
<p>
You might know this as "Automation".
<p>
Gnumeric is also available to other applications as a Bonobo
component.  (<a
HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/arch/component/bonobo.html">Bonobo</a>
is the compound document architecture of GNOME).  This enables your
application to embedd Gnumeric into your application for editing, or
displaying information.  One line of code would achieve all the magic
you need.

<p><h2>Plugin system</h2></p>

Gnumeric has a plugin system based on shared libraries right now
(which means that all plugins right now fall under the GNU GPL). A
plugin exists for defining your own functions in Python.
<p>
Gnumeric exports a number of CORBA interfaces that enable programmers
to control Gnumeric remotely within an authenticated GNOME desktop

Gnumeric 1.0.3 is now available.

	This release syncs up with Guppi.  1.0.3 requires Guppi 0.40.3.  The
	graphing interface has been improved a bit.  Several other extensions
	have come in under the wire before the gnome2 port takes over the
	development tree.  Many thanks the Andreas, Neil, and the testers for
	their valiant attempt to make the COUP functions MS Excel (tm)
	compatible.  When it was revealed that Excel was not compatible with
	itself, they were able to simplify the code, and limit the calculations
	to being correct.

	I've back-ported a nice performance patch for
	    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68723
	It is NOT enabled by default but the code can be enabled by toggling
	an #define in src/eval.c.  The patch appears to work smoothly, but I'm
	not going to monkey with the dependency engine in the stable branch,
	even for 2 orders of magnitude.

Gnumeric 1.0.2 is now available.

	This is a mainly a bug fix release, but a few new features trickled in
	just to keep things fun.  The most important patches are to
	    - Fix a crash when when reading old xml that had expressions
	      formated as 'text' (don't do that).
	    - Fix a regression in 0.99.0 when importing 3d references.
	    - Fix a crash in some searches

	This will be the last release before the development tree branches
	to 1.1 and the port to gnome2.  We will continue to support 1.0 but
	changes will ideally be limited to bug fixes and translations.

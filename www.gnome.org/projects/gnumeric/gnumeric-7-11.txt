   Enhancements dept:

	  Nick Lamb.

	- When inserting/moving columns or rows, the cells moved now
	  do not change their formulas (to keep the sheet working).

Enjoy,
Miguel.Hello guys,

   Gnumeric "International Manatee" 0.8 has been released.

   This version is available in:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric-0.8.tar.gz

   The most important change in International Manatee is the fact that
the documentation that Adrian Likins wrote is now integrated into the
build system.  It gets installed and we feature a reference guide for
the internal Gnumeric functions. 

   These are the features of International Manatee:

	- Bruno enabled the coloring page for setting the foreground
	  color. 

	- The sheet label name works properly now (it no longer
	  "slides"). 

	- Correct behaviour of clicking in the presence of editing the
	  sheet label name.

	- Guile support now needs to be explicitly configure
	  (--with-guile).
	
	- Fix crashing problems repoted when autofilling.

	- Documentation is included in the tarball (You need DocBook
	  if you plan on extending the documentation or fixing my
	  ugly, ugly, ugly stuff :-).  You can find Docbook here:

		ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/home/rosalia/docware.
	
	  A docbook tutorial is available in:

		http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro.html

	  The full docbook documentation can be downloaded for free
	  from the Davenport site (I lost the url to this, but I am 
	  confident all of you documentation-savvy people are good
	  at altavistaing things).

Enjoy,
Miguel.

Hello,

   I have released a new version of Gnumeric, pretty much a bug fix
over the Numerically Skillfully Cow release of Gnumeric.

   Thanks to all of you who send me good bug reports, here is a list
of the bugs fixed and improvements:

	- Excel loading code improved again by Michael Meeks.  He also
	  spotted a number of bugs in the code which were fixed.

	- Paste was not properly recomputing formulas pasted.

	- Gnumeric no longer crashes on save.

	- Dependecy computation code got fixed.  Horribly typo was
	  doing all sorts of nonsense ;-)

Fetch it from:

   ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric/gnumeric-0.11.tar.gz

Miguel.

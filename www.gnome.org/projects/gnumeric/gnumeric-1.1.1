Gnumeric 1.1.1 aka 'Tweedle Beetle Noodle Poodle Puddle Paddle Battle' is now available.

	Let the good times roll.  Development has been proceeding briskly.
	Things are not ready for use in a production setting (graphs and
	printing are disabled) however, most of gnumeric is functional again
	and working at least as well as v1.0.

	In addition to porting there have been lots of improvements of all
	shapes and sizes.  Jakub has contributed some new artwork,  Andreas has
	been coding like a demon to use GtkTreeView in the revamped 'sheet
	management' dialog and a newly beautified sorting guru.  After some
	useful feedback Morten has been improving precision all over the place,
	even offering an optional use of 'long double' as the primary data type.
	An initial implementation of protection has also been contributed.  Jon
	Kåre deserves a round of applause for deciphering exactly what MS Excel
	means when it generates 'auto' colours (hint do not trust the docs).

	This snapshot has the docs build disabled pending repairs after
	converting to xml.

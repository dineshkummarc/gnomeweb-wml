      <p><h1>Screenshots</h1>
<ul>
<li>When you first launch Gnumeric, it looks like <a
href="new-pics/startup.png">this</a>
<li>The new cell format dialog has been much improved, some
	pictures here show the <a
href="new-pics/format-background.png">background</a>, <a
href="new-pics/format-border.png">border</a>, <a
href="new-pics/format-font.png">font</a>, and <a
href="new-pics/format-number.png">number </a> pages.

	<li>Gnumeric has a number of <a
href="new-pics/analysis-tools.png">Analysis tools</a>, once
	you select a tool, you get to run it with your own data as
	shown <a href="new-pics/regression.png">here</a>.  Of course
	we do have a <a href="new-pics/goal-seek.png">Goal seek</a>
feature.

	<li>You can see how Gnumeric <a
href="new-pics/patterns.png">supports the various excel
	patterns and border types.</a> Of course, the coloring there is
	terrible, but that just proves that we were not born with
	a clear idea of good visual composition.

	<li>You can customize the printing options in a number of
	ways: <a href="new-pics/print-setup.png">Page setup</a>, <a
href="new-pics/print-header-footer.png">headers and
	footers</a>, <a href="new-pics/print-margins.png">margins</a>,
	<a href="new-pics/print-page.png">page details</a>.

	<li>Printing is achieved using the GNOME printing architecture
	which provides a unified API to print.  Here you can see
	the <a href="new-pics/print-preview.png">print preview</a> in
	action.  Gnome Print uses Type1 fonts and supports fully
	anti-aliasing of them, so you get a high quality printing, you
	can see a detail here after the preview has been <a
href="new-pics/print-zoom.png">zoomed in.</a>

<li>We do support many usability features found on other
	spreadsheets, here you can see a <a
href="new-pics/editing.png">formula being entered</a>
</ul>

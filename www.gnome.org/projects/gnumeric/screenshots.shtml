      <p><h1>Screenshots</h1>

<ul>
<li>When you first launch Gnumeric, it looks like <a
href="new-pics/startup.gif">this</a>
<li>The new cell format dialog has been much improved, some
	pictures here show the <a
href="new-pics/format-background.gif">background</a>, <a
href="new-pics/format-border.gif">border</a>, <a
href="new-pics/format-font.gif">font</a>, and <a
href="new-pics/format-number.gif">number </a> pages.

	<li>Gnumeric has a number of <a
href="new-pics/analysis-tools.gif">Analysis tools</a>, once
	you select a tool, you get to run it with your own data as
	shown <a href="new-pics/regression.gif">here</a>.  Of course
	we do have a <a href="new-pics/goal-seek.gif">Goal seek</a>
feature.

	<li>Gnumeric acts as the test-bed for the <a
href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/corba/book1.html">Bonobo
	component architecture and compound document architecture for
	Unix systems</a>.  Here you can see <a
href="new-pics/bonobo-embedded.gif">Gnumeric embedding a
	shaped Gill object</a> (an SVG file).

	<li>You can see how Gnumeric <a
href="new-pics/patterns.gif">supports the various excel
	patterns and border types.</a> Of course, the coloring there is
	terrible, but that just proves that we were not born with
	a clear idea of good visual composition.

	<li>You can customize the printing options in a number of
	ways: <a href="new-pics/print-setup.gif">Page setup</a>, <a
href="new-pics/print-header-footer.gif">headers and
	footers</a>, <a href="new-pics/print-margins.gif">margins</a>,
	<a href="new-pics/print-page.gif">page details</a>.

	<li>Printing is achieved using the GNOME printing architecture
	(gnome-print, yes, we do need a web page for this too).  This
	enables us to use a unified API to print.  Here you can see
	the <a href="new-pics/print-preview.gif">print preview</a> in
	action.  Gnome Print uses Type1 fonts and supports fully
	anti-aliasing of them, so you get a high quality printing, you
	can see a detail here after the preview has been <a
href="new-pics/print-zoom.gif">zoomed in.</a>

<li>We do support many usability features found on other
	spreadsheets, here you can see a <a
href="new-pics/editing.gif">formula being entered</a>
</ul>

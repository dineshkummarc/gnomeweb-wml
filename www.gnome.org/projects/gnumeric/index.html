<A NAME="whatis"></A>What is Gnumeric</H3>

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</A> desktop environment: a project
to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.&nbsp; As every
other component of GNOME, Gnumeric is <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</A>&nbsp; (Some other people like to call this OpenSource
software) and it is licensed under the terms of the GNU <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL.</A>
<p>
Gnumeric will import your existing Excel, 1-2-3, Applix, Sylk, XBase and Oleo
files.  If you are a developer and you want to contribute new importers (or
polishing and perfect existing importers) we welcome your patches.
<P>
Gnumeric is intended to be a replacement for a commercial spreadsheet,
so a lot of effort and work has still to go into it, but I believe we
have the right framework to do it.
<p>
The Gnumeric spreadsheet is developed with the GNU C compiler and the
user interface is prototyped and designed using the Glade GUI
designer.

<h3>Helping in Gnumeric</h3>

From introductory to more advanced, there are lots of projects
available.  Contact the <A HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list@gnome.org">list</A> for
more information.  If you are interested in helping the development of
Gnumeric, check the list of <a
href="http://www.gnome.org/todo/index.php3?match_string=gnumeric&category=0&required_skill=0&required_familiarity=0&status=0&update_time=5&query=Find">
pending tasks</a>.

<h3>
<a name="screenshots"></a>Screenshots</h3>
These screenshots are for version 0.42 of Gnumeric (a few
versions old)
<ul>
	<li>When you first launch Gnumeric, it looks like <a
	href="new-pics/startup.gif">this</a>
	
	<li>The new cell format dialog has been much improved, some
	pictures here show the <a
	href="new-pics/format-background.gif">background</a>, <a
	href="new-pics/format-border.gif">border</a>, <a
	href="new-pics/format-font.gif">font</a>, and <a
	href="new-pics/format-number.gif">number </a> pages.

	<li>Gnumeric has a number of <a
	href="new-pics/analysis-tools.gif">Analysis tools</a>, once
	you select a tool, you get to run it with your own data as
	shown <a href="new-pics/regression.gif">here</a>.  Of course
	we do have a <a href="new-pics/goal-seek.gif">Goal seek</a>
	feature.

	<li>Gnumeric acts as the test-bed for the <a
	href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/guides/corba/book1.html">Bonobo
	component architecture and compound document architecture for
	Unix systems</a>.  Here you can see <a
	href="new-pics/bonobo-embedded.gif">Gnumeric embedding a
	shaped Gill object</a> (an SVG file).

	<li>You can see how Gnumeric <a
	href="new-pics/patterns.gif">supports the various excel
	patterns and border types.</a> Of course, the coloring there is
	terrible, but that just proves that we were not born with
	a clear idea of good visual composition.

	<li>You can customize the printing options in a number of
	ways: <a href="new-pics/print-setup.gif">Page setup</a>, <a
	href="new-pics/print-header-footer.gif">headers and
	footers</a>, <a href="new-pics/print-margins.gif">margins</a>,
	<a href="new-pics/print-page.gif">page details</a>.

	<li>Printing is achieved using the GNOME printing architecture
	(gnome-print, yes, we do need a web page for this too).  This
	enables us to use a unified API to print.  Here you can see
	the <a href="new-pics/print-preview.gif">print preview</a> in
	action.  Gnome Print uses Type1 fonts and supports fully
	anti-aliasing of them, so you get a high quality printing, you
	can see a detail here after the preview has been <a
	href="new-pics/print-zoom.gif">zoomed in.</a>

	<li>We do support many usability features found on other
	spreadsheets, here you can see a <a
	href="new-pics/editing.gif">formula being entered</a>
</ul>

<P>You can see some older <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/screenshots">screenshots</A> of
Gnumeric.

<h3>
<a name="download"></a>Downloading</h3>

You can download the gnumeric sources from: <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnumeric">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnumeric
</a>

Binaries for <a
href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/math/gnumeric.html">For
Debian</a> are maintained by Vincent.

You can get Red Hat 6.x binaries from Gnumeric usually from <a
href="ftp://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/gnumeric/html">RPM find</a> and Red Hat 5.2 from <a
href="ftp://wacko.gxsnmp.org/pub/RPMS/">Greg's site</a>

<h3>Graphs in Gnumeric</h3>
Support for graphics is coming up nicely using the Bonobo architecture
and a graphics component that is aimed at emulating all of the plot
modes from Excel.  Work on integrating Guppi's advanced charting is also
progressing.  More plotting types can be added in the future.

<H3>
<A NAME="future"></A>Future projects</H3>

A reorganization of the number formating is pending, along with a cleaner
separation of Model, View, and Controllers.  To learn more about our plans read
the README and the Future-Roadmap
files included with Gnumeric.

<p>
Michael Meeks, Jody Goldberg, Arturo Tena, Frank Chiulli, Jeff Garzik,
Robert Brady and Sean Atkinson are working on the import / export code.
Talk to them if you are interested in helping the project.

<H3>
<A NAME="corba"></A>CORBA, compound documents</H3>

As part of the GNOME desktop, Gnumeric uses the <A
HREF="http://cvs.labs.redhat.com/ORBit">ORBit</A> CORBA implementation
to expose its services to the world.  This means that you can remotely
control Gnumeric from any language that has CORBA bindings for it.
Recently Owen Taylor's <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/corba/orbit.html">Perl bindings
for CORBA/ORBit</a> has caused a great deal of interest for
controlling Gnumeric remotely.
<p>
You might know this as "Automation".
<p>
Gnumeric is also available to other applications as a Bonobo
component.  (<A
HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/arch/component/bonobo.html">Bonobo</A>
is the compound document architecture of GNOME).  This enables your
application to embedd Gnumeric into your application for editing, or
displaying information.  One line of code would achieve all the magic
you need.

<H3>
<A NAME="plugin"></A>Plugin system</H3>

Gnumeric has a plugin system based on shared libraries right now
(which means that all plugins right now fall under the GNU GPL). A
plugin exists for defining your own functions in Python.
<p>
Gnumeric exports a number of CORBA interfaces that enable programmers
to control Gnumeric remotely within an authenticated GNOME desktop

<H3>
<A NAME="lists"></A>Mailing lists</H3>

The Gnumeric mailing list can be reached at <A
HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list@gnome.org">gnumeric-list@gnome.org</A>.  If
you want to subscribe to the mailing list, send mail to: <A
HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list-request@gnome.org">gnumeric-list-request@gnome.org</A>
and in the body of your message put the word "subscribe". The lists are also <A
HREF="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnumeric-list/">archived</A>.
Please read some <A HREF="mailing-list.html">advice</A> before sending mail.

<H3>
<A NAME="getting"></A>Getting Gnumeric</H3>

As with any other software in GNOME, you can fetch the latest
development version of Gnumeric from the <A
HREF="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">GNOME Anonymous
CVS</A> and from the GNOME CVS from the module "gnumeric".  <P>To
compile Gnumeric you will need the gnome-libs package and the
gnome-xml package. The gnome-libs package in turn requires the glib, gtk+
and imlib packages.

<H3>
<A NAME="bugs"></A>Reporting Bugs</H3>

Firstly, please make sure that you have the latest version of gnumeric before
reporting bugs. Gnumeric is undergoing extensive and rapid development and your
bug is likely to have been silently fixed.

<P>The standard procedure for bug reporting is detailed at <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/">http://bugs.gnome.org/</A> please ensure that
your bug hasn't already been logged by checking the <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgnumeric.html">list</A>.
It would also help if you CC. your mail to gnumeric-list@gnome.org.

<P>There are certain types of bug that we are especially interested in. Gnumeric
should <b>never</b> die (SEGV) if it does please, please put the effort in 
to submit a bug report, it will save others lots of grief.

<h3>
<a name="support">Contractual support</h3>

<a href="http://www.helixcode.com">Helix Code Inc.</a> provides <a
href="http://www.helixcode.com/gnumeric">contractual support</a> for
Gnumeric for any extensions, or special developments you might need
from Gnumeric.
<p>
All the code written by Helix Code is released under the terms of the GNU
GPL.  If the code extension is general enough your extension might be
folded into the main Gnumeric distribution.

<H3>
<A NAME="Thanks">Thanks to</a></H3>

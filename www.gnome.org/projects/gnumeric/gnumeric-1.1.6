Gnumeric 1.1.6 aka 'I/O I/O its off to work we go' is now available.

    Lots and lots of toys to play with here.  Jukka-Peka has returned with a
    vengeance adding several more functions.  He's well past XL at this point
    in terms of random number coverage.  Protected regions are starting to be
    meaningful, Andreas is plugging the gaps.  Morten has been working to
    enable optional (at compile time) use of long double to increase precision
    by brute force,  and has been working on various functions to improve the
    precision of the algorithms  For my part I've been poking at the core and
    finally completing the Model View Controller split for Sheets.  This means
    that unshared views now work.  There is also partial support for calculated
    and 3d references.  On the import/export side the excel, lotus, and Applix
    plugins have been improved and a Quattro Pro importer added.

    NOTE : libole2 is no longer required.  We now use libgsf (version 1.1.0 was
	just released)

    NOTE : We have disabled building 1.1 using gcc-2.96.  There are a few known
       areas where the compiler shipped with RH/Mandrake was causing numeric
       inaccuracies in Gnumeric.  If you don't mind that feel free to manually
       remove the prohibition.

WARNING  WARNING WARNING

    NOTE : This is a DEVELOPMENT RELEASE it is not supposed to be stable We do
	not warrant that it will not cause you, your dog, or your mother's
	army boots, to burst into flame.

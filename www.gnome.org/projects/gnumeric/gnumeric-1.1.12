Gnumeric 1.1.12 aka 'Bring it on' is now available.

    This release marks the start of the run up to the next stable
    release.  While there are still some big pieces left to arrive,
    much of the 1.2 checklist is complete and we're starting to
    audit things.  Morten has been hard at work checking the import
    plugins for UTF-8 cleanliness and looking at the analytics.
    I've finally spent some time working on the MS Excel XM/2k/97
    exporter and pronounce it ready for testing.  There are still
    missing bits (sheet local names) but the majority of the content
    should get though at a decent size.  There are a few nice shiny
    bits, like the beginnings of rotated text and the death of the
    import menu (thanks Jon Kåre).  This release should feel a good
    bit zippier now that we've transitioned to foocanvas and enabled
    even more just in time rendering.

    NOTE : Although this is a development release it should be quite
      stable.  There are is still feature regressions from 1.0
      (porting graphs to gtk2) but other than that this release should
      be usable.  Please play with it.

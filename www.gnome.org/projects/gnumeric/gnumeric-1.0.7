Gnumeric 1.0.7 is now available.

    This is a bug fix release, new development is being done in version 1.1.x
    based on gnome2.  This is a high priority update for a couple of reasons
	- A patch in 1.0.6 broke xls export of empty strings.  This fixes that
	  and enables those file to be read by Gnumeric.
	- The translators hard work has paid off, the function manual has now
	  been shipped in translated form to 12 languages.
	- An oft requested feature to support 1 click import of tab delimited
	  files has been added.  No need to use the import guru for simple
	  things anymore.

    Many thanks to Ray Dassen (Debian maintainer) for helping to improve
    portability and patching niggly warnings from gcc-3.1

	patched.  For those of you who were experiencing this crash _please_
	test 1.0.7.  I'd like to close the report.

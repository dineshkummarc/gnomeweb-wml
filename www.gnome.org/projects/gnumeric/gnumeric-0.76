Gnumeric 0.76 aka 'ice ice baby' is now available.

	We have now frozen the interface and all user visible text in
	preparation for release.  Translators, and Documenters its all yours.
	The target release date is Dec 15, with a hard deadline of Dec 31.
	There will be less translated release candidate versions before then.

	Andreas and Jukka did more work on the analytics improving both the UI
	and the accuracy.  Several new contributors also chimed in with some
	nice extras, like reverse auto-fill.  Morten and I continued to patch
	leaks and audit code.

	This is primarily a bug fixing release as several people took me up on
	the the bug bounty.  NOTE : The bounty still applies, if you are the first
	to find a repeatable crash, I'll give you a beverage of choice.  The
	BEVERAGES file contains a list.

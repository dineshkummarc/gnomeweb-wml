Gnumeric 0.64 aka 'Do the Bartman' is now available.  This is a release
candidate for Gnome 1.4.  It fixes one memory problem and improves the plugin
architecture.  Almer also solved the long time wishlist item for the scrollbar
to do live and delayed scrolling.  All the other changes are largely cosmetic
polishing and improving corner cases.

Note to packagers : The version requirement for gnome-xml (libxml1) has increased
                    to 1.8.10

NOTE : Please do not package or submit bug reports for gnumeric-bonobo.  Bonobo
       has been frozen for GNOME 1.4 but has not yet become part of the
       official platform.  It is fairly stable but not yet the default build.

<h3>Gnumeric 1.2.0 aka &quot;Emb-Ext&quot; is now available.</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The next generation of Gnumeric is ready for general use.&nbsp; It
has taken almost 20 months to make the jump to Gtk+-2.x without feature
regressions.&nbsp; We've put the time to good use.&nbsp; This release
is faster and lighter than 1.0.x, but boasts an impressive array of new
and extended capabilities. Details available <a href="new-features-1.2.html">Here</a>
<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The breadth and stability of Gnumeric's analytics enabled us to receive a grant from
<A href="http://blogs.osafoundation.org/mitch/">Mitch Kapor</A> (creator of
Lotus 1-2-3) to develop an interoperability test suite with leading proprietary
competitors.  The money will be used as form of bounty to fund the expansion of
our <A
href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/function-info.shtml">existing
tests</a> for worksheet functions (eg =SUM, or =ODDFPRICE).  Our goal is to
ensure that a users data will produce the same results (or better :-) using
Gnumeric. The test suite will be in xls format, and will be freely available to
all other interested projects.  <p> Exact prices have not been decided as yet,
but this is an excellent opportunity for non-coders to help open-source programs,
and earn a bit of money too.  Specifics to be announced on the <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnumeric-list">mailing lists</a>
in the coming weeks.  <p> Official announcement <A

<blockquote>"Persons who wish to use a spreadsheet to perform
statistical analyses, and who are concerned about the accuracy of their
results, are advised to use Gnumeric rather than Excel."<br>

Sciences at Drexel University and a noted authority on the accuracy of
statistical software<br>

<blockquote>"...  the many advantages of using open source software such as Gnumeric
are quickly overtaking the one advantage of using Microsoft's proprietary Excel
software, namely interoperability with other users of Excel."<br>

In addition to the source tarball and packages from all of the standard
distributions Ben Liblit of the
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~liblit/sampler">Bug Isolation project</a>
has made some specially
<a href=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~liblit/sampler/downloads">
instrumented packages for Red Hat 9</a>
that can provide feedback in the unlikely event that somethings breaks.&nbsp;
Please consider trying these packages.&nbsp; Hopefully, 1.2.x will be at least
as&nbsp; stable as 1.0.x, and will generate very little data :-)<br>

<blockquote>
The 1.2.x branch is stable, and will receive bug fixes and translations updates
only.&nbsp; We follow the standard GNOME versioning conventions, and intend to
branch 1.3.x branch within the next few weeks to begin the next phase of
development.  The next release is planned to coincide with GNOME-2.6 and the
other GNOME Office components.<br>

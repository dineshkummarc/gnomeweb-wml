Gnumeric 0.61 aka 'your mother was a hamster' is now available.  This is a
point release that polishes and fixes existing features.  It is high priority
for users of Cell Comments and Sheet Objects, but only moderate priority for
everyone else.

This is a high priority upgrade.

NOTE : the glibc-2.2 bug mentioned in the last release has been fixed
	for Debian in glibc-2.2-5.  I have not verified other distributions.

Gnumeric 1.1.2 aka 'weeee that tickles' is now available.

    Lots of tasty tidbits in here.  Andreas has been rolling right along moving
    the GUI to gtk2 and improving it along the way.  Morten  has lept in with
    some nifty optimizations (memory and performance) and the rest of us have
    been tacking on new toys as fast as we can type.  MS Excel (tm) import has
    improved handling of named expressions along with support for encrypted
    workbooks.

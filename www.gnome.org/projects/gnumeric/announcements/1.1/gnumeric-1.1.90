Gnumeric 1.1.90 aka 'Release Candidate 1' is now available.

    This is primarily a spit and polish release.  It fixes the missing
    documentation files from the 1.1.20 release.  There are a few extensions to
    the charting engine, and a much improved image selector for objects.  The
    main substantive change relates to the handling of empty cells passed as
    arguments to optional parameters.

    If all goes smoothly this will become 1.2.0 next week around Sept 14th.

    NOTE : Package this release.  It is stable enough for general deployment
	and use, for all intents and purposes 1.1.x is now at least as
	stable as 1.0 (we hope)

Gnumeric 1.1.14 aka 'Team Gnumeric rules!' is now available.

	This release is a team effort on lots of different core infrastructure.
	Jon Kåre leapt into fray and moved all of the export plugins over to
	libgsf, which left us with nice clean interfaces, and lots of
	flexibility about where we save (embedded documents or network files)
	He also tacked on a nice delayed splash screen that comes up if loading
	files takes more than 3 seconds, most people will, hopefully, never see
	it :-) In addition to his usual leak plugging, and algorithmic cleanup
	Morten split out the expression conventions (XL vs OO vs Applix) and
	used it for import and export.  Which puts us in a good position to
	make the jump to a new file format.  I did some more work on XL 97/2k/XP
	export and added full support for AutoFilters, SUBTOTAL, and finished
	off some bells and whistles for outlining.

	This release should be treated with some caution.  There is enough new
	stuff in here especially on the parser side that you'll want to keep
	backups of your data until it gets more testing.

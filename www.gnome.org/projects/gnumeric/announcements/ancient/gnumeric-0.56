Gnumeric 0.56 aka 'Australian philosophers' has been released.  This version
adds depth to existing features, fixes some bugs, and has several usability
enhancements to boot.  It is strongly recommended that people upgrade as this
release fixes a rather serious problem that would bloat memory when used when
using large sheets.

ATTENTION PACKAGERS : libole2 has now been officially split into a separate
                      package.  This library is required for MS excel support.

There is no release number 0.55 !
It was released this morning, however what we thought would be a long drawn
out bug hunt evaporated and it seemed important enough to re-release to get
the long standing XL export problem fixed.

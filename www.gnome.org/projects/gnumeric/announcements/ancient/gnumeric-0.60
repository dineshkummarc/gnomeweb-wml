Gnumeric 0.60 aka the 'Bring me a bucket' release is now available.  This
version includes a couple of high priority bug fixes.  The addition of some new
artwork spruces things up and the display engine now handles merged cells.

This is a high priority upgrade.

WARNING to Debian unstable, Redhat 7 users,  and anyone else using glibc-2.2
Locale support in all current packages of glibc-2.2 breaks in Gnumeric.  A
patch has been made and applied to the glibc source tree but no release
includes it as yet.  Users in locales other than C should avoid the 2.2 series
for now.

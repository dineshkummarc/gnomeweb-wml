Subject: Gnumeric 0.34 has been released


Hello guys,

   I just released a bug fix version of Gnumeric that will enable the
international files to be build in your machine (the actual code did
compile on my machine, I do not know why distcheck did not notice the
missing files).

   I also took a chance to update the documentation (I have to
manually regenerate this on each release).

Availability:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric

Best wishes,
Miguel.

Gnumeric 0.68 aka 'the ice pane cometh' is now available.

This is a _development_ release.  There are several fixes for problems in
previous releases (some serious) however this release also adds support for
frozen panes which required some non-trivial adjustments.  We did more
usability tuning so scrolling should now feel smoother.  Thanks to auspex,
UnNamed, jwz, and acuster for their suggestions.

There are known limitations to this release.  Most importantly frozen panes
will only show sheet objects in the lower right pane.

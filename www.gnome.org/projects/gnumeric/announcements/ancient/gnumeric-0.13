Hello guys,

   I have just released Gnumeric "Superstitious Bonobo" 0.13.  This
version is as usual available in:

 	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric

These are the new features in this version:

	1. Excel loading is much faster now (Michael Meeks)

	2. More excel sheets load now (Michael)

	3. Various compilation fixes from Tim Mooney for some
	   strict C compilers (Digital C compiler in this case).

	4. Now it recalcs cells when you have cleared values or
	   removed cells (just a missing call to workbook_recalc was missing). 

	5. Install/compile fixes from Raja Harinath.

	6. Implemented new functions: "ISERROR" and "NOT".

	7. Copy/paste fixes in the presence of errors in the spreadsheet.

	8. Small display glitch fix.

	9. Add type checking to functions that take a constant number of arguments. 	

	10. Upper case format letters are now accepted.

Enjoy!

Miguel.

Hello number lovers,

    I have released the Numerically Skillfully Cow release of the
Gnumeric Spreadsheet.

New in this version:

	* Many updates on the Excel side, optimizaitons, bug fixes,
	  more features supported (Michael Meeks, Sean Atkinson).

	* Support for adding/removing sheets on the notebook tabs

	* A small draw fix (g's, j's and y's are no longer cropped).

	* Mime types for Excel files are shipped (but no gnome icon
	  for XL files yet).

	* Fixes to the CVS loader (Vincent Renardias).

	* Perl plugin is shipped again.

You can get this from:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric

Happy sums,
Miguel.

Hello guys,

   I have just released a new version of Gnumeric (gnumeric-0.5), this
version is available in:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric-0.5.tar.gz

   The highlights of this version are:

	- A pluggable framework for file formats.  No need to hack the 
	  code to add your file loader anymore, routines are provided
	  to register file loading and saving formats.

	- (bug fix) Fixed the broken storage setup I introduced in the
	  previous version.  This means that files are now correctly
	  loaded and that if an expression renders an error you will
	  still be able to access the information you stored.

Enjoy this new version,
Miguel

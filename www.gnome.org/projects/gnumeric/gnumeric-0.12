Hello,

   New Gnumeric version, this is the miguel-will-be-out-until monday
release of Gnumeric, I will be visiting Boston, so if you are in the
area we could probably meet.

   New features:

	- New function TRUNC

	- Excel loading: Michael Meeks and Sean did lots of work again
	  on improving our Excel importer.

	- Internal fix that the Excel code was hitting.

	- Fixes the menu for the quick operations (on the workbook)

	- Fix to the rename-sheet function (it was displaying garbage
	  sometimes)

	- Brunno finished the support for coloring the background of
	  cells, so now we can have nicely colored sheets with nice
	  backgrounds :-)

	- He also finished the foreground setting color code.  Thanks!

	- Now it warns if you drop a range of cells in a region that
	  already has values.

	- Should include the missing files for the Perl plugin.

	- CSV code disabled until it is fixed.

	- Stricter control for removing active sheets in the code.

	- Michael provided an icon for Excel files.

	- Contributed Spanish documntation from Pablo.

Best wishes,
Miguel.

 <p><h1>Agnubis</h1></p>

<p>
Agnubis is the GNOME Presentation Program comparable to such programs
as Microsoft PowerPoint or Corel Present. It has been developed and designed
for the GNOME 2 plattform and is created to integrate well with the rest of the
components in the GNOME Office suite.
</p> 
<p>
Agnubis is currently in the CVS server of GNOME Spain. It will be moved to the main GNOME CVS server shortly however.

	<h2>Keeping Track</h2>
      
      <p>The key to Tomboy's usefulness lies in the ability to relate notes and
      ideas together.  Using a <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb">
      WikiWiki</a>-like linking system, organizing ideas is as simple as typing
      a name.  Branching an idea off is easy as pressing the <b>Link</b> button.
      And links between your ideas won't break, even when renaming and
      reorganizing them.</p>

      <h2>Accessing your notes</h2>
      
      <p>Accessing your notes is usually a quick mouse-flick away.  Just click
      on the Tomboy Panel applet, which is always visible on your desktop.  You
      can choose one of the notes you've recently viewed from the menu or
      <b>Search</b> for older notes.  The <b>Table of Contents</b> lists all your
      notes in the order they were last modified.</p>

      <p>No more moving your applications to find a website you dragged to the
      desktop.  No more searching your filesystem to find where you think you
      maybe put last week's TODO list.</p>
      
      <h2>Friendly Editing</h2>

      <p>Tomboy supports many advanced editing features, but they won't bother
      you until you need them.  Stream-lining the interface as much as possible
      to avoid distractions is a key goal of ours.  <i>Because software should
      never slow your momentum!</i></p>

      <p>It is a top priority for Tomboy to be able to handle all the sorts of
      information you want to keep track of.  We are currently developing
      support for linking-to and managing all the <b>Desktop Objects</b> you
      interact with, all from within a simple note interface. Try dragging an email
      to your note!</p>
      
      <h2>Plugins</h2>
      
      <p>Tomboy isn't limited to certain set of features - extend it as you wish.

<h5 id="platform">Contact platform</h5>

<ol>
<li>How can I build a contact platform? 
<p>
Follow the instruction on given on this web page: <a href="construction_contact_platform.html">"Instruction on how to build a contact platform to measure jump capacity"</a>.

<p><li>Where can I buy a contact platform? Can I sell the one I built myself?
<p>
We don´t trade the contact platforms, instead we advice those who want to use this method to build their proper platform. If any person or company ever decide to produce them by the method we have taught or any other compatible method and decide to commercialize, an aware can be given to us so that we can divulge this service even though we are not responsible for the quality of the products. 
<p><li>Why does the steel has to be warmed?
<p>
The steel of the contact platform will be submitted to a number of pressures, if warmed it will resist better and it will also have a better capacity to return to its initial position.
<p><li>Why don´t you use photoelectric cells?
<p>
Because so far no one has collaborated offering such information on how to build them, where to buy, prices, and delay on detection of events…We are thankful to receive such collaboration.
<p><li>I have found a better manner to build the contact platform, where could I advertise it? 
<p>
Write an e-mail to the list <a href="contact.html">chronojump-list</a> and we will be trying to find a way to announce your proposal.

</ol>

<h5 id="chronopic">Cronometer Chronopic</h5>

<ol>
<li>Why the need of a chronometer if any computer can cover this function?
<p>
The modern operative systems are multifunction, this mean that the computer need a certain quantity of time to develop each function in a way that seems to be executing all functions at the same time.
If the computer is in charge to receive the stimulus arrived from the contact platform, in certain occasions it may delay the events because it will be developing others<i>subjects</i>, this may cause problems of reliability due to the jumps of same length of time could have different measurements on different circumstance. <br>
The output chronometer that we have built is special on receiving those events given on the contact platform, avoiding the reliability errors when registering the events. <br>
Moreover Chronopic permits the use of Chronojump or its reduced version: Chronojump-mini to be used in any electronic display, assuring a good compatibility toward the future. <br>
For more information, please read this article: <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/chronojump/articles/chronojump_sistema_de_medida_congreso_gpul.pdf">"Proyecto Chronojump: Sistema de Medida de la Capacidad de Salto usando Software y Hardware Libres"</a> (spanish).

<p><li>I have read that the current chronometer is a prototype, when will the final version be released? 
<p>
For the construction of chronopic it has been used a training card of robots Skypic, taking the chance of a free software, its construction has been documented and it is possible to acquire directly besides it has been also validated. 
<br>So far we have an expansion card that permits the Skypic connection with to contact platform and a software (firmware) permitting Skypic to be completely functional on the detection of stated and events on the contact platform. <br>
Soon a Chronopic card will be released using less instruction than Skypic and also reduced dimensions and it will be build easily or acquired by a reduced price (15-30 euros in Spain).<br>
For more information, please read the webpage: <a href="http://www.iearobotics.com/personal/juan/proyectos/chronopic/1.0/">documentaci&oacute;n de Chronopic 1.0 y el prototipo 1</a> (spanish).

<p><li>How can I build the chronometer?<p>

<h5 id="chronojump">Software Chronojump</h5>

<ol>
<li>Can I accede the source code  and modify the program? And also sell it? 
<p>
Chronojump is a free software distributed under the terms of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL"> GPL license </a>, and this permit you to study, modify, redistribute and sell according to the license above. For more information web de <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL">GPL on Wikipedia</a>.

<p><li>¿How much does it cost?
<p>
On the web it will always offer a free Chronojump version, but you can also commercialize if you wish your own version, we recommend you to offer extra services to the clients that decide to buy them. You may offer courses to trainers, consultant, integration of the platform + chronometer + software in one machine, …you can also offer the program on any course, class or conference you are involved.

<p><li>In what operative systems and computer equipment does it work?
<p>
Chronojump has been written for the programming platform <a href="http://www.mono-project.com">MONO</a>, that has been conceived in order to facilitate the work of the computer programs in different operative systems and computer equipments. So far it works in GNU/Linux and Windows systems.<br>

<p><li>How can I download the program? <p>
Accede the web page <a href="installation.html">Chronojump install</a>.

<p><li>Can I try Chronojump even though I don´t have either the chronometer or the contact platform?
<p>
Yes, it has been created a simulation mode of jumps, races of different lengths of time, reaction time and rhythms, so that it is possible to try the program features.

<p><li>When it will be the release of the 1.0 version and what benefits will it have?
<p>
Nowadays (version 0.52) Chronojump already have more benefits than any other commercial or non – commercial resolutions that we know. 
<!--
But there are still a number of aspects to improve, as we can see on the following document <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/chronojump/roadmap.txt">roadmap</a>.
-->
<br>
If you wish to ask the features please write us an e-mail to the mail list <a href="contact.html">chronojump-list</a>.

<p><li>How can I know the last news of the project?
<p>
Subscribe or check the files on <a href="contact.html">mailing lists</a>. Or check <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/chronojump/changelog.txt?view=markup">changelog</a>.

<p><li>Why is it called Chronojump, does it also work to measure races, reaction times and rhythms?
<p>
The initial idea was the creation of a software destined to measure temporal jump events, but it was seen that with a little more effort the same software can be used to chronometer all kinds of races, reaction times and rhythms. Even though we are now working on these bases, the initial efforts will be centered on jumps measurements, that is why Chronojump maintains its original name.

<p><li>I would like to collaborate, how can I do it?
<p>
Write to the mail list <a href="contact.html">chronojump-devel-list</a> introduce yourself, explain why do you want to collaborate and what are your knowledge

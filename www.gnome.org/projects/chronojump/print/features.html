Characteristics of the management software
</h4>

ChronoJump allows to register any jump with the repetitions that is desired,  initiating in or outside the platform, registering independently times of contact and flight times, as well as extra load, height of fall, jumps or time limitation and descriptions of technique.
<p>
ChronoJump uses a small data base <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite</a> that enables to tie jumps to subjects and sessions, and to make all type of comparisons between these events.
<p>
It is possible and simple to create new types of jumps with the described variables previously.
<p>
It is multiplatform; being programmed in C# using Mono, it would have to work correctly in GNU/Linux, MacOSX, Windows... until the moment works in GNU/Linux and Windows.
	<p>
It incorporates the following statistics (whenever the opposite does not specify itself, it is allowed to show averages, maximum values, or all the values of only one session or between an indetermine number of sessions (longitudinal), and with distinction of sex)
	<ul>
	<li>Summary of one or several sessions
	<li>Study of an only subject
	<li>Flight time of simple jumps
	<li>Contact time, flight time and index between both event, in jumps with fall and in repetitive jumps (shortly will be also implemented the takeoff speed).
	<li>Power in repetitive jumps
<li>Evolution of repetitive jumps (only in one session)
	<li>Index of elasticity and index of arms use
<li>...  (ChronoJump modularity makes easier the inclusion of new statistics)
	</ul>

Chronojump allow to record also <b>races</b>, <b>reaction time</b> and <b>rhythm</b>.

<p>
	Graphics of all the statistical described by means of the graphical library <a href="http://netcontrols.org/nplot/">NPlot</a>.
	<p>
	Export jumps to spreadsheets  (CSV format).
	<p>
	Create personalized reports of all data and statistics (HTML format).

	<h5>Characteristics of the timekeeper</h5>

	The  Chronopic timekeeper is based on the trainning card Skypic (consult the documentation), and offers a precision of one millisecond according to what has been able to verify. <tt>[Pending to detail how has been verified]</tt>.
	<p>
	Some jump timekeeper systems use only a personal computer connected directly to the platform. The modern computers are multitask, characteristic that prevents to guarantee a trustworthy measurement because they can be making any other task in a given moment.

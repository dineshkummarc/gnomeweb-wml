Construction of Chronopic_juanfer prototype
</h4>

Juan Fernando Pardo has started to release an own Chronopic version, simpler and cheaper.
<br><br>
He managed to build it in one hour, and the total price in Argentina is like 22 US$

<br><br>
If you want to use the other Chronopic -more expensive (70 Euros in Spain)- check the <a href="construction.html">construction page</a>.

Notes:
<ul>
<li>All the components are mounted on a prototyping board
<li>Red, Brown and Orange lines are wires located at the bottom face of the board. Both extremes of the wire are soldered to the pins of the components.
<li>The blue line is wire located at the top face of the board. Both extremes of the wire are soldered to the pins of the componentes.
<li>It is recommend the use of sockets for the MAX232 and PIC16F876A components, instead of soldering them directly to the board.
</ul>

<h1>Translation of Epiphany</h1>

<h2>About the GNOME Translation Project</h2>

<p>
You are probably reading this because you are interested in the
localization, or translation, of Epiphany. Epiphany is using the GNOME
Translation Project (or GTP for short)
for translations. The GTP web page is at:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/</a>
</p>

<p>The GTP is a large team of volunteering translators (probably a lot
like you) that translate the GNOME applications that they like into
their native language. The GTP is divided into many language teams, all
with their own team coordinator, and some with their own mailing list
and website.
</p>

<p>
To help us with Epiphany translations, we'd <em>really</em> like you to join the GTP and join your respective language team first. Joining is easy, what it takes is more
or less just subscribing to some mailing lists. More on that below.
</p>

<p>There's a lot of reasons why we want you to do this. First of all,
you will not be required to translate anything - it's all up to you,
even if you join the GTP. Second, we'd really hate if there later was
discovered that someone had done duplicate work - there might already
be someone working on a Epiphany translation for your language, but
there's no way to know until you have contacted your language team and
asked if someone is already working on a
translation. In most cases that's probably not the case, but asking
first might save a lot of trouble later.
Third, your translation team has people that probably have translated a
lot of applications into your language before, and they can usually
help you with any translation question (technical or linguistic) that
you might have.
Fourth, every translation team usually has at least one person with
access to the GNOME CVS repository (where Epiphany development takes
place), and he/she
can commit your finished translation directly into this CVS repository.
</p>

<p>Instructions on how to join the GTP are on the GTP web site,
mentioned above. To join the GTP itself, you should (as mentioned on
the GTP page) subscribe to the gnome-i18n@gnome.org mailing list. This
can be done by going to:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-i18n/">http://lists.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-i18n/</a>
</p>

<p>Subscribing to this mailing list will also make sure you get
information when a new version of Epiphany will soon be released and
the translations need updating.
</p>

<p>On the GTP site, you can also find information about existing
language teams and their coordinators, and also web sites and mailing
lists. Please let the coordinator for your language know that you will
be working on a Epiphany translation. If there's a mailing list for the
language team, consider joining it. That way you can ask other
translators in your native language, if you have
any problems when translating.
</p>

<h2>Getting the pot file</h2>

<p>&gt;From now on I will assume that you have done the above, and
joined the GTP and the team for your language. Now we come to the part
on how to actually translate. You need at least one important software
package installed on your system to be able to translate: "gettext".
Please make sure that you have this package installed before you begin.
</p>

<p>To be able to start a new translation you need the application's
untranslated messages, which is stored in a so called pot file (suffix
.pot). The pot file for Epiphany can either be fetched from the web or
generated from Epiphany source code taken from CVS.
</p>

<h3>Fetching the pot file from the translation status pages</h3>

<p>The easiest way to get the pot file is to fetch the pot file from
the web. You'll find it on the GNOME translation status pages, located
at:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/status/">http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gtp/status/</a>
</p>

<p>
If you browse these pages you should find a reference to Epiphany and be able to download a pot file for it.
</p>

<h3>Generating the pot file from Epiphany source code in CVS</h3>

<p>Another way of getting the pot file is by using anonymous GNOME CVS
access. If you do intend to get the pot file this way you need to make
sure that you have the software "intltool" installed on your computer.
It should always be the latest available version; if it isn't, please
upgrade before you begin.
</p>

<p>When you use CVS you need to checkout the "EpiphanyMODULE" module
and go to the "po" directory of the module. Instructions on how to use
anonymous GNOME CVS access are at:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html</a>
</p>

<p>
When you have checked out the module, go to the "po" directory inside it and run:
</p>

<pre>	intltool-update --pot
</pre>

<p>
This should create the pot file for you.
</p>

<h2>Translating</h2>

<p>Once you have the pot file, rename it to xy.po, where "xy" in the
file name should be the language code of the language you are
translating to (like "sv" for Swedish). Then it's just a matter of
filling out the headers (if you are not sure about what the headers
should be, ask your language team), and filling out the pairs:
</p>

<pre>	msgid "This is a message from the application."
	msgstr ""
</pre>

<p>In the example above, your translation should go inside the quotes
after the msgstr. Proceed this way until all messages in the file have
a translation. If you are unsure about anything regarding this, ask
your language team.
</p>

<p>Once you have completed the translation, you should check
that it is encoded in the "UTF-8" encoding (we require translations to
be encoded in UTF-8). You can make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8 by
running:
</p>

<pre>	msgconv -t UTF-8 xy.po &gt; xy.po.new &amp;&amp; mv xy.po.new xy.po
</pre>

<p>You should also make sure that the translation is syntactically correct. You can do that by doing this:
</p>

<pre>	msgfmt -cv xy.po
</pre>

<p>If there is any error, please go back and correct it before
continuing. When all errors are gone, send the translation to a person
in your language team that has GNOME CVS access, and ask him/her to
please commit it. If you send the file by mail, it's usually a good
idea to first compress the file with "gzip", since otherwise some mail
software may do bad things and not preserve the encoding.
</p>

<p>That's it. If you have any questions regarding the PO format,
gettext or translations, please ask your language team. If the question
is specific to Epiphany (such as the messages themselves or Epiphany
code), ask Epiphany
developers.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for your help!

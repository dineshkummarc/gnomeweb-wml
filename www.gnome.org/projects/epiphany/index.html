	<h2>What is Epiphany?</h2>

	<p><strong>Epiphany</strong> is the web browser for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop. Its goal is to be <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/documentation/manifesto.html">simple</a> and <a href="http://usability.gnome.org/">easy to use</a>. Epiphany ties together many GNOME components in order to let you focus on the Web content, instead of the browser application. As part of the GNOME project, Epiphany is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.</p>
	<p>
	Epiphany displays webpages with the same speed and accuracy as other popular browsers, such as Safari or Firefox. In addition, it provides an elegant, responsive and uncomplicated user interface that fits in perfectly with GNOME, and it has been translated to over sixty languages!

			</p>

		<div class="feature">
			<h4>Customizable user interface</h4>


			<img src="images/customizable.png" alt="[Customizable interface]" />


			<p>
			Epiphany lets you arrange user interface elements by simply dragging and dropping with your mouse. It also provides tabs, so you can easily organize related webpages on your computer screen.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h4>Smart bookmarks</h4>

			<img src="images/smartbookmarks.png" alt="[Epiphany smart bookmark]" />


			<p>
			<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/smartbookmarks.html">Smart bookmarks</a> make it a snap to lookup text in online knowledge bases, like dictionaries or search engines. Also, you don't have to keep track of in which subfolder you put that one bookmark -- just assign it some topic(s) and Epiphany will show you the relevant bookmarks in a dropdown menu.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
			<h4>Extensions and plugins</h4>


			<img src="images/extensions.png" alt="[Epiphany Extensions]" />


			<p>
			Need some specialized browser function that's not available in the default menus? There's a good chance someone has already written an extension for you. The <a href="extensions">Epiphany Extensions</a> package is what you will need. Epiphany runs all the same popular plugins that run in Mozilla.

This is a template that projects can use when doing something for use in gnome.org/projects/, at least until we get a real CMS.

Key notions: 

* try to have a page for developers, a page for users,
and some notion of how to get the software.

* try to have at least some nice-looking screenshots.

* if you've got a nice icon, use it to spruce up the page.

    <title>Installation of GNOME</title>

   <para>Our LiveCD, available from www.gnome.org, allows you to try a full GNOME desktop on Linux without installing anything on your hard drive. This is the best way to see the latest GNOME for yourself.</para>
  
   <para>For actual use, we recommend that you install official packages, such as those for your Linux distribution.</para>

   <para>However, if you would like to build GNOME from source code, to test the very latest versions, to provide feedback and improvements, we recommend a build tool; such as the <ulink url="http://cipherfunk.org/garnome/">GARNOME</ulink> utility, for building from released tarballs, and <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/jhbuild">jhbuild</ulink>, for building from CVS.</para>

    <title>So, why GNOME?</title>

   
    <para>
  Having seen some of the new features in GNOME &version;, why choose GNOME
  over other desktop environments? Every GNOME volunteer has their own
  motivations, of course, but here are some of the common reasons many
  of us choose to work on and use GNOME.
  </para>
  
    <sect2 id="rnwhy-usability">
      <title>Usability</title>
      <para>
        GNOME is the only open source desktop project to take a stand
    for ease of use and UI consistency over feature creep and
    hyper-configurability.  Our <ulink
    url="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/"> Human
    Interface Guidelines</ulink>, developed by a team of GNOME
    volunteers and UI professionals, and released before GNOME 2.0,
    are the most complete Free Software usability guidelines in
    existence. Every application in the GNOME Desktop release has
    benefited from this focus on consistency and usability. We believe
    that this focus will produce a user environment that "just works"
    and as a result lets GNOME users -both experienced and
    inexperienced- focus on doing real work instead of struggling to
    learn new applications.

    <title>Accessibility</title>
      
    <para>
      Beyond making GNOME easier to use for the average computer user,
          GNOME has also taken the lead in making the Unix desktop
          accessible to those with disabilities. The GNOME accessibility framework 
          is used by our award-winning accessibility tools like the GNOME
          Onscreen Keyboard (gok), Gnopernicus, and Dasher. These allow 
          the use of braille readers, voice synthesizers, and pointing
          devices. Many governments, including the US government,
          require comprehensive accessibility support in software they
          purchase. After dozens of person-years of effort, GNOME is
          the only free software desktop to thoroughly address this issue.

    <sect2 id="rnwhy-interface">
       <title>Interface Stability</title>
       <para>
       The core libraries in the GNOME Development Platform carry
       guarantees of API and ABI stability. This means that 'porting'
       an application from GNOME 2.0 to GNOME &version; 
       involves no work, if a developer does not wish to
       take advantage of new functionality in the libraries.

          Popular and robust Free Software applications such as
          Mozilla, Eclipse, Evolution, Gnumeric, Abiword, Gaim,
          X-Chat, and more are based on GNOME or GTK+. These
          applications are among the most powerful and capable in the
          Free Software world, and we expect that they'll only get
          better as they take more advantage of the GNOME development
          environment. In addition, other important desktop projects,
          like Mono, Java, and OpenOffice.org, are working on
          integrating with GNOME and GTK+.

    <title>Organization</title>
    <para>
      GNOME &version; is the third 'time-based' GNOME release. Because
      GNOME releases on a regular schedule, contributors know that
      their contributions will be in a stable release and on the
      desktops of users everywhere within a short, predictable period
      after they contribute. In addition, people who want to deploy
      GNOME know that they can count on regular releases when they are
      planning rollouts or integration with their own products.
    </para>
    <para>
      Additionally, the GNOME Foundation allows companies to support
      GNOME, while at the same time ensuring the independence of the
      board by ensuring that they are selected by the developers who
      work on GNOME. This infrastructure helps organize releases,
      and sponsors the annual GUADEC conference and the regular North 
      American summits.

          All GNOME platform libraries are licensed under the <ulink
          url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</ulink> or similar
          license, so developing for the GNOME platform is 100% free of license
          fees, for developers of both Free and proprietary software.

      <title>Support and Staying Power</title>
      
        <para>
          GNOME is here to stay. Besides the active GNOME community
          (which has now supported and developed GNOME for over five
          years), many of the biggest supporters of the Unix desktop
          are GNOME contributors, including HP, MandrakeSoft, Novell
          (through Ximian), Red Hat, and Sun Microsystems.

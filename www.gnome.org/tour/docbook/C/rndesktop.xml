  <sect3 id="rnnautilus"><title>The File Manager</title>
    <para>
     The file manager, also known as Nautilus, is even faster and more stable in 
     GNOME &version;, thanks to changes to its internal architecture. This should 
     allow software developers to maintain and extend the file manager more easily in future.
    </para>
    <para>
     Drag and drop with other applications, such as Mozilla and Firefox, now also works more smoothly.
    </para>

    <para>In addition, there are many small changes that demonstrate GNOME's attention to detail. For instance,
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The path button is now more obviously a button.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>When creating new files, renaming starts automatically.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>When using keyboard navigation to open the parent folder (Alt-Up), the current folder will be selected.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>

  <sect3 id="rnmetacity"><title>Window Behaviour</title>
    <para>GNOME &version; has a new ability that you might not notice at first, implementing another cross-desktop Freedesktop.org standard.</para>
    <para>In the past, while typing something into one application when suddenly your instant messenger offered a chat request from your friend, your words would be typed into the chat window. Imagine if you were typing your password at the time. This should no longer happen in GNOME &version;.</para>
    <para>In addition, if an application takes a long time to start, your work will not be interrupted when it finally opens its window.</para>

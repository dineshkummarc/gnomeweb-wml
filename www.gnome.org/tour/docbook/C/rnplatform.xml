  <title>Development Platform</title>
  <para>The GNOME Development Platform provides a stable base for third-party software developers, and for the GNOME Desktop itself. GNOME maintains backwards compatibilty and API-stability while adding new features.</para>

  <para>Applications may be developed in a variety of programming languages, including C, C++ (via <ulink url="http://www.gtkmm.org/">gtkmm</ulink>), Java (via <ulink url="http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/">java-gnome</ulink>), Perl (via <ulink url="http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net/">gtk2-perl</ulink>), and Python (via <ulink url="http://www.pygtk.org/">pygtk</ulink>).</para>

  <para>All GNOME platform libraries are licensed under the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</ulink> or similar license, so developing for the GNOME platform is 100% free of license fees, for developers of both Free and proprietary software.</para>

  <para>GNOME is the platform of choice for many popular and robust Free Software applications such as Mozilla, Eclipse, Evolution, Gnumeric, Abiword, Gaim, X-Chat, as well as a in-house and proprietary software. These applications are among the most powerful and capable in the world, and we expect that they'll only get better as they take more advantage of the GNOME development environment. In addition, other important desktop projects, like Mono, Java, and OpenOffice.org, are working on integrating with GNOME and GTK+.</para>

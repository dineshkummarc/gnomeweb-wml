<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

<h3><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010">Boston Summit 2010</a></h3>
<i>November 6–8 2010, MA, USA</i>
<p>The Boston Summit is a three-day hackfest for GNOME developers and contributors. It is not primarily aimed at users or new contributors, but if you want to jump right into the deep end, it's a fantastic way to meet everyone and get involved. Unlike traditional conferences, the Boston Summit is all about getting developers together and getting things done. While there are some non-hacking sessions, they are geared heavily towards many-to-many, interactive discussion and planning, rather than one-to-many presentations.</p>
<p>Please go to the a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010">2010 Summit page</a> and tells us you are coming!</p>

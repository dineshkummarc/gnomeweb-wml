<p>The GNOME project is proud to release this new version of the GNOME desktop environment and developer platform. GNOME 2.32 features a limited set of new features in some applications, as GNOME developers continue to focus on the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release: metacontacts for instant messaging, improved PDF support, file management improvements, but also changes for developers like full support for Python and Vala in the IDE.

The GNOME community would like to engage more women with the project through its <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/outreach/women">Outreach Program for Women</a>. The internships will allow women to work with assigned mentors on programming, graphic design, documentation, or marketing projects.

<h3><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010">Boston Summit 2010</a></h3>
<i>November 6–8 2010, MA, USA</i>
<p>The Boston Summit is a three-day hackfest for GNOME developers and contributors. It is not primarily aimed at users or new contributors, but if you want to jump right into the deep end, it's a fantastic way to meet everyone and get involved. Unlike traditional conferences, the Boston Summit is all about getting developers together and getting things done. While there are some non-hacking sessions, they are geared heavily towards many-to-many, interactive discussion and planning, rather than one-to-many presentations.</p>
<p>Please go to the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010">2010 Summit page</a> and tells us you are coming!</p>

<h3>Earthquake in Chile</h3>
<p>This last February 27th Chile was hit by a 8.8 magnitude earthquake.<br>
GNOME is not removed from this tragedy since it has always relied on the
invaluable friendship and collaboration from developers and users in
Chile.<br>
This value became evident when just moments after the earthquake when
people in the GNOME community first started to express concern and
worry about our friends in Chile.<br>
From GNOME we would like to send all our sympathy and support to our
friends in Concepción, Curicó, Talca, Santiago, Viña del Mar, Valparaíso
and everyone in Chile.<br>
Fuerza Chile.

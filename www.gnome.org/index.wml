<i>September 19, 2009</i>
<p>The GNOME Community is a excited to promote and participate in

be celebrating software freedom and the work that GNOME has done to
make a free desktop accessible for all.</p>

<p>Software Freedom is about a technology future that we can trust, that
is sustainable, and that supports the basic human freedoms. Untrusted
electoral systems can lead to civil unrest and a lack of trust in
governing bodies. Proprietary data formats can mean lockout to
accessing our own information! Software Freedom can be maintained by
transparent systems (such as Free and Open Source Software) that are
based on open, secure and sustainable standards including data formats
and communication protocols.</p>

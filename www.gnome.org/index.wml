<h3><a href="http://foundation.gnome.org/reports/gnome-report-2009-Q3.pdf">GNOME Report Q3 2009</a></h3>
<p>The GNOME Foundation would like to present the Q3 2009 Quarterly report (<a href="http://foundation.gnome.org/reports/gnome-report-2009-Q3.html">HTML version</a>). Q3 is always a big quarter for the GNOME Foundation and this one was bigger and better than usual. During Q3 we had our annual GUADEC, and GNOME 2.28 was released with lots of preparation work for GNOME 3.0. OSiM Mobile was well attended by GNOME Mobile member companies and products that use GNOME Mobile technologies like Moblin 2.0 and the Nokia N900 were released. We've raised $23,415 through Friends of GNOME so far this year! Our Advisory Board members have been very generous as well and we have many hackfests planned for Q4! <a href="http://foundation.gnome.org/reports/gnome-report-2009-Q3.pdf">Read on</a> to hear what GNOME teams have accomplished in Q3 and what they are planning for Q4!</p>

<h3><a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/">GNOME 2.28 Released!</a></h3>
<p>The GNOME project is proud to release this new version of the GNOME desktop environment and developer platform. Among the hundreds of bug fixes and user-requested improvements, GNOME 2.28 has several highly visible changes: seamless integration with bluetooth devices, simpler desktop sharing and a generally smoother user experience. Learn more about GNOME 2.28 through the detailed <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.28/">release notes</a> and the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2009-09-gnome228.html">press release</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2009-09-softwarefreedomday.html">GNOME promotes Software Freedom Day</a></h3>
<p>The GNOME Community is a excited to promote and participate in
Software Freedom Day. Around the world, GNOME community members will
be celebrating software freedom and the work that GNOME has done to
make a free desktop accessible for all.</p>

<p>Software Freedom is about a technology future that we can trust, that
is sustainable, and that supports the basic human freedoms. Untrusted
electoral systems can lead to civil unrest and a lack of trust in
governing bodies. Proprietary data formats can mean lockout to
accessing our own information! Software Freedom can be maintained by
transparent systems (such as Free and Open Source Software) that are
based on open, secure and sustainable standards including data formats
and communication protocols.</p>

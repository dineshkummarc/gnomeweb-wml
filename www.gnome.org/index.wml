<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>
<h3><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007">Boston Summit 2007</a></h3>
<i>October 6-8, Boston MA, USA</i>
<p>The Boston Summit is a three-day hackfest for GNOME developers and
contributors. It is not primarily aimed at users or new contributors, but if
you want to jump right into the deep end, it's a fantastic way to meet
everyone and get involved.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional conferences, the Boston Summit is all about getting
developers together and <em>getting things done</em>. While there are some
non-hacking sessions, they are geared heavily towards many-to-many,
interactive discussion and planning, rather than one-to-many
presentations.</p>

<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007">Come along and get
involved!</a></p>

<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

<h3><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2008">Boston Summit 2008</a></h3>
<i>October 11-13, Boston MA, USA</i>
<p>The Boston Summit is a three-day hackfest for GNOME developers and contributors. It is not primarily aimed at users or new contributors, but if you want to jump right into the deep end, it's a fantastic way to meet everyone and get involved.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional conferences, the Boston Summit is all about getting developers together and <em>getting things done</em>. While there are some non-hacking sessions, they are geared heavily towards many-to-many, interactive discussion and planning, rather than one-to-many presentations.</p>
<p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/Boston2008">Come along and get involved!</a></p>

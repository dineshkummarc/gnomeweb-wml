BORLAND JOINS GNOME FOUNDATION ADVISORY BOARD

Borland To Support Linux® Desktop With Upcoming Kylix[tm] Development Platform

Las Vegas, Nev. -- November 15, 2000 -- Inprise Corporation (Nasdaq: INPR), herein
referred to as Borland, today at the Linux Business Expo announced its reaffirmed
commitment to open-source development by joining the GNOME Foundation Advisory Board.
Borland teams with firms such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Red Hat and Helix Code to foster
development of the GNOME desktop environment and application framework.

"The GNOME Foundation is pleased to have the support of Borland," said Miguel Icaza,
founder of the GNOME Project. "Borland's long history of component architecture
experience will be invaluable to helping further the Bonobo component project in
creating reusable software components and compound documents. We are looking forward to
their contributions to GNOME and their work to help developers bring their applications
to the GNOME platform using Kylix[tm]."

Borland is introducing the first rapid application development (RAD) platform, Kylix,
which aims to enable users to quickly and easily build and deploy native Linux®
applications. Kylix will be based on the design of Borland's award-winning Delphi[tm]
and C++ Builder[tm].

"We're delighted to become a part of the GNOME Foundation and to help take GNOME award
development to RAD developers," said Michael Swindell, director of product management of
the RAD Tools group at Borland.

"Borland's participation in the GNOME foundation aims to help developers build great
GNU/Linux applications that look, feel, and behave natively in multiple desktop
environments,"continued Michael. "A significant part of this effort will be working
closely with GNOME's Bonobo component project and companies like Eazel and Helix Code to
deliver Bonobo component support to Kylix developers."

About Kylix[tm]

Kylix is intended to be the first high-performance rapid application development (RAD)
platform for the Linux platform. Kylix is a component-based development environment for
two-way visual development of graphical user interface (GUI), Internet, database and
server applications. Kylix will be powered by a new high-speed native Delphi/C/C++
compiler for Linux and will implement a native Linux, and cross-platform version of the
Borland VCL (Visual Component Library) architecture called CLX[tm]. CLX is designed to
radically speed native Linux application development and simplify the porting of Delphi
and C++ Builder applications between Windows® and Linux operating systems. To learn

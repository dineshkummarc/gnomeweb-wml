			<h1>Overview</h1>

			<p>To be held on July 18th, 19th and 20th, the
			Boston GNOME Summit will be an intensive
			working laboratory during which members of the
			GNOME project will get together to discuss
			development issues, demonstrate their work,
			and generally continue the upward trend in the
			project's momentum.  The goal for this set of
			meetings is to accelerate the development and
			planning work that will lead to GNOME 2.2.</p>

			<p>The intent of the Summit is to be a
			get-together and a hackfest, not a formal
			planning event.  If you cannot attend, this
			does <i>not</i> mean that you are left out of
			the GNOME 2.2 planning process.  That said, we
			would ideally like as many of the key GNOME
			developers to attend as is possible.</p>

			<h1>Attendance</h1>

			<p>The Boston GNOME Summit is open to <a
			    href="http://foundation.gnome.org/membership.html">GNOME
			    Foundation members</a>.  If you would like to attend
			  the Summit and are not yet a member of the GNOME
			  Foundation, you should <a
			    href="http://foundation.gnome.org/membership-form.html">apply
			    for membership</a>.</p>

			<p>If you are planning to attend, you must <a
			href="register.php">register for the
			Summit</a> before July 1st, 2002.</p>

			<p>The summit currently has a maximum of 75
			attendees.</p>

			<h1>Agenda and Schedule</h1>

			Soon, we will have one of these.  If you want to
			give a talk, host a planning session or do a demo at

			<h1>Places to Stay</h1>

			<h2>Hotels</h2>

			  <p>Below is a brief list of hotels in the Boston
			    area, with their quoted prices for room reservations
			    during the Summit.  We are currently looking for
			    cheaper hotels in the Boston area to house attendees
			    of the Summit, and checking into bulk rates at some
			    of these hotels.</p>

			<h2>Couches and Floors</h2>

			<blockquote>

			  What with <a
			    href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian</a> being
			  Boston-based, there should be a certain amount of
			  crash space available for people who need it.  The
			  Ximian people will try to devise some kind of
			  mechanism for reserving couch/floor space; once said
			  process has been established, details of its
			  operation will be posted here.

			</blockquote>

			<h1>Funding</h1>

			The Boston GNOME Summit needs money!
			Currently the foundation has very little cash
			available to pay for the classrooms and other
			costs associated with putting on the Summit.
			If you or your company are interested in
			contributing to the Summit, send mail to <a
			href="mailto:fundraising@gnome.org">fundraising@gnome.org</a>.

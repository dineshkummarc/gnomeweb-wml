			<h1>Overview</h1>

			<p>To be held on July 18th, 19th and 20th, the
			Boston GNOME Summit will be an intensive
			working laboratory during which members of the
			GNOME project will get together to discuss
			development issues, demonstrate their work,
			and generally continue the upward trend in the
			project's momentum.  The goal for this set of
			meetings is to accelerate the development and
			planning work that will lead to GNOME 2.2.</p>

			<p>The intent of the Summit is to be a
			get-together and a hackfest, not a formal
			planning event.  If you cannot attend, this
			does <i>not</i> mean that you are left out of
			the GNOME 2.2 planning process.  That said, we
			would ideally like as many of the key GNOME
			developers to attend as is possible.</p>

			<h1>Attendance</h1>

			<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Update (July 1st)!</b></font> As of today, the official
			registration deadline has lapsed.  However, we
			still have a number of spots open for people
			who want to attend the summit, and so we are
			now opening the <a
			href="register.php">registration</a> up to
			anyone who wants to attend the summit.  So,
			whoever you are, if you want to come to the
			summit, please register now.</p>

			<p>We still have a maximum of 75 attendees, so
			<a href="register.php">register now</a> to
			ensure that you can make it!  Registration
			will be closed when we hit our cap.</p>

			<h1>Agenda and Schedule</h1>

			Soon, we will have one of these.  If you want to
			give a talk, host a planning session or do a demo at
			the Summit, please send mail to <a
			  href="mailto:gnome-planning-summit@gnome.org">gnome-planning-summit@gnome.org</a>.

			
			<h1>Location &amp; Facilities</h1>

			<p>The conference will be hosted in classrooms at the <a
			    href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of
			    Technology</a>, in Cambridge.</p>

			<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Update (July
			1st)!</b></font> Please note that we will not
			be providing workstations for people without
			laptops.  Wireless access points will be
			deployed for people with laptop computers and
			802.11 cards, but those of you who do not have
			these items will be left out in the cold.  We
			are so very sorry.</p>

			<p>There is the possibilities that we will be
			able to provide some extra wireless cards for
			people who do not already have them and want
			to borrow them, but you should not count on us
			for this.</p>

			<h1>Places to Stay</h1>

			<h2>Youth Hostels</h2>

			<h2>Hotels</h2>

			<blockquote>
			  <p>Below is a brief list of hotels in the
			  Boston area, with their quoted prices for
			  room reservations during the Summit.  Please
			  note that these rates are probably going up
			  as time goes by: Boston can be quite sublime
			  in the summer, and the tourists filter in
			  and drive up the rooming prices as we
			  progress into July.</p>

			  <p>
			    <b><u>Cambridge Marriott - Kendall Square (Cambridge)</u></b><br>
			    $119.00 + tax<br>
			    single or double occupancy<br>

			<h2>Couches and Floors</h2>

			<blockquote>

			  What with <a
			  href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian</a>
			  being Boston-based, there will be a certain
			  amount of crash space available for people
			  who need it.  When you <a
			  href="register.php">register</a>, be sure to
			  check the "Help!  I need a place to stay"
			  box, and we'll do our best to find some
			  space for you.  No promises, of course

			</blockquote>

			<h1>Funding</h1>

			The Boston GNOME Summit needs money!
			Currently the foundation has very little cash
			available to pay for the classrooms and other
			costs associated with putting on the Summit.
			If you or your company are interested in
			contributing to the Summit, send mail to <a
			href="mailto:fundraising@gnome.org">fundraising@gnome.org</a>.

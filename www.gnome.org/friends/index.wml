Thanks to donations, 
in 2008 we were able to:
<ul>

<li>Run an Accessibility Outreach Program that resulted in 6 long-term tasks completed with three more on going in documentation, magification and mouse control through a webcam.</li>

<li>Organise a GTK+ hackfest that was widely seen as successful for getting the GTK+ developers in the same place and was essential to planning the future of GTK+. We plan to build on this success by using the hackfest </li>

<li>Grow our world-wide community of developers, including holding our first GNOME.Asia in Beijing last October.</li>

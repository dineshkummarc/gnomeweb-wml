<h1>Become a Friend of GNOME!</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Diego,</p>

<p>I'm 30 years old  and I live in Og&iacute;jares, a small town of Granada, Spain. I read and write but I'm still learning. I use an electric wheelchair to move around and I need some help for my daily tasks. I attend the Cerebral Palsy Association that is in the capital and called ASPACE Granada.</p>

<p>I'm happy because I can now use the computer in my classroom without any assistance, which was not possible before because I needed help to log into the system and to open the programs. With GNOME 3 I am learning to use the whole operating system because it is much easier than any other. Because my movements are not very accurate and I can hardly see the fine print, I wasn't able to use other systems. I use the screen magnifier and the exclusion of repeated keystrokes.</p>

<p>What I most like to do is to search for music videos and write letters to my friends. I'm also discovering some of the games that come with the system. I could not imagine that I would only use a computer on my own. A big hug to everyone,  Diego.</p>

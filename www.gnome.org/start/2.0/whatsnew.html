	  The lengthy GNOME 2 development cycle allowed the introduction of a
	  number of features that improve performance and usability. It also
	  includes a powerful new framework that can be leveraged by developers.

	Streamlining, consistency and coherence have been the primary foci for
	GNOME 2 Usability work. Above all we have tried to consider you, the
	user, as the focus of our design.
      </p><p>
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Streamlining:</em></span> Rather than adding a great pile of
	new gadgets and preferences, GNOME 2 has been streamlined. Interface
	clutter had led to a GNOME where you could almost literally &quot;do less
	with more&quot;. GNOME 2 removes many obscure or rarely used features (one or
	two of which may have been dear to you personally). In exchange you will
	find that most of the features you care about are much easier to access
	because they are not obscured by a million other items.
      </p><p>
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Consistency:</em></span> Interfaces that behave according to
	consistent patterns are easier to learn, faster to use, and less prone to
	error. The <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/" target="_top">GNOME Human
	Interface Guidelines</a> have helped make the GNOME 2 interface more
	predictable, producing consistency between applications and promoting
	usable patterns within individual applications.
      </p><p>
	<span class="emphasis"><em>Coherence:</em></span> The GNOME 2 desktop fits together
	well. From &quot;Log In&quot; to &quot;Log Out&quot;, usability studies,
	countless brainstorming hours, and tireless hacking have produced a
	holistic desktop - more than a loose confederation of modules.
      </p><p>
	Specific user-visible improvements include:

		GNOME 2.0.2 exhibits notable performance
		improvements over its predecessors and some competitors, even on older,
		slower machines:

		</p><p>
		  <span class="emphasis"><em>(And to brag, its faster than Windows XP on my laptop,

		</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2766447"></a>Keyboard Navigation</h3></div></div><p>
		Thanks to the <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/" target="_top">
		  GNOME Accessibility Project</a>, GNOME 2 has improved keyboard 
		navigation, including mnemonics that are easier for developers to 
		implement, improved keyboard navigation of the new tree widget and 
		key bindings that are more consistent where standards already exist.
	  </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="a11y"></a>Accessibility</h3></div></div><p>
		Keyboard navigation is a key part of accessibility support that will be
		useful to all users, but there are many other aspects to it.
      </p><p>
		The core of accessibility support is a set of hooks in GTK that allow 
		an external program to query applications about their GUI. For 
		example, an external program can ask what buttons and menu items 
		there are, their state, what their labels contain, and so on. This can 
		be used by a screen reader to tell a blind user what's on the screen, 
		for example.
      </p><p>
		This would allow a high-level scripting feature with commands
		such as &quot;activate the File menu, choose 
		Open, Select All,
		Copy&quot; This kind of scripting would use high 
		level user comprehensible GUI features and would not depend on special
		application support for scripting. It would just work automatically 
		with any GTK app. 
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="i18n"></a>Internationalization</h3></div></div><p>
		Internationalization has two major changes:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
			  GNOME 2 has moved to Unicode throughout, so you can mix multiple 
			  languages and scripts in the same document, and use funky 
			  symbols such as bullets and dingbats in a document.
			</p></li><li><p>
			  GNOME 2 handles &#8220;hard&#8221; languages such as right-to-left
			  languages and languages that have ligatures and
			  reordering. 
			</p></li></ul></div><p>
		One major implication of Unicode is that the same code paths will now 
		be used for European and Asian text, so GNOME will almost certainly 
		work out-of-the-box for people in all countries (except for input 
		methods). 
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="libxml"></a>XML</h3></div></div><p>
	GNOME 2 marks the first GNOME release to use <a href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/" target="_top">libxml2</a>, one of the most complete and
	standards-compliant free XML libraries available. It
	includes libxslt, a complete implementation of
	the XSLT specification.

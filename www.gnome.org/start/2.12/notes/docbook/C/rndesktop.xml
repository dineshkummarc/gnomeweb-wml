    <para>
     The file manager, also known as Nautilus, has several user interface improvements in 
     GNOME &version;. Most noticeably, the list view can now show files in directories, allowing you to navigate down to a sub-folder and open a new folder window only when necessary. Also for your convenience, the Bookmarks menu now shows the same locations as the File Chooser dialog.
    </para>

    <para>In GNOME &version, dragging text from an application to a Nautilus window will save you time by creating a new text document. You'll also notice that GNOME now shows a preview of the text being dragged, instead of just an icon.</p>

    <para>
     There are also major improvements to the browse mode, making it similar to GNOME's existing File Chooser dialog:

      <listitem><para>Places and Bookmarks may be displayed in a sidepane.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The location is now show with the GNOME's path bar instead of a text entry. The text path is still available via the Control-L keyboard shortcut.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>


    <para>GNOME &version; provides a new selection of pre-installed background images and patterns, so your desktop can become your own.</para>

  <sect3 id="rnmetacity"><title>Window Behaviour</title>
    <para>GNOME &version; has a new ability that you might not notice at first, implementing another cross-desktop Freedesktop.org standard.</para>
    <para>In the past, while typing something into one application when suddenly your instant messenger offered a chat request from your friend, your words would be typed into the chat window. Imagine if you were typing your password at the time. This should no longer happen in GNOME &version;.</para>
    <para>In addition, if an application takes a long time to start, your work will not be interrupted when it finally opens its window.</para>

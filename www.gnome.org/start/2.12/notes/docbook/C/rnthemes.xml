    <para>The new Theme preferences dialog is simpler and more powerful. Previously there were several independent theme systems for various parts of the user environment. You can now control all of this in one place without needing to be aware of these details. Themes can now change the appearance of window borders, controls, and the icons used on your desktop and panel.</para> 

    <para>For the technically orientated, this means that the theme manager dialog brings together window manager themes, GTK+ themes, and icon themes.</para> 
    
	<para>GNOME &version; offers several built-in themes. See <ulink url="http://art.gnome.org">art.gnome.org</ulink> for more. Or you can edit a theme and save the new theme, all from within the theme manager.</para>

  <title>What's New For Administrators</title>
  
    <para>
    GNOME &version; has new features to make life easier for system
    administrators, including users who manage their own computers.

    <title>Improvements for Sabayon</title> 

    <para>As part of work to support the <ulink
    url="http://www.gnome.org/projects/sabayon/">Sabayon</ulink> user
    profile manager, GNOME startup reads and touches fewer
    settings. Besides small performance gains, this means that GNOME
    2.12 is easier to administer than ever, particularly in
    combination with Sabayon, which while not officially part of
    GNOME, makes setting up user profiles for GNOME very easy.</para>

   <sect2 id="rnsysadmin-menueditor">
    <title>Menu Editor</title>

    <para>
    GNOME's Applications menu now uses the freedesktop menu
    specification, so applications can be easily installed regardless
    of the desktop environment used. GNOME &version; has a simple tool
    to lets you edit the menu, and because the infrastructure is
    standards compliant, other 3rd-party tools are becoming
    available.</para>

    <title>System Tools</title>

    <para>
    The system tools allow you to configure your system clock and your network connection, as well as manage the users and groups on your system. At present, these system tools are most appropriate for single computers rather than large networks of computers.
    </para>

    <para>
    GNOME &version; provides a new Services Administration tool, which allows you to choose which services will be started when the computer starts.</para>

    <title>Log Viewer</title>

    <para>
    The GNOME log viewer makes investigation easier by showing all logs in one tabbed window and allowing you to browse 
    logs in a calendar. The new version navigator also helps when viewing archived logs.</para>

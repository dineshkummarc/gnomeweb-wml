    <title>Installation of GNOME &version;</title>

   <para>For GNOME &version; we have a LiveCD, available from <ulink url="http://gnome.org/projects/livecd/">gnome.org/projects/livecd/</ulink>. The LiveCD allows you to try a full GNOME desktop on Linux without installing anything on your hard drive. This is the best way to see for yourself what's new.</para>
  
   <para>For actual use, we recommend that you install official packages, such as those for your Linux distribution. Vendors are likely to package GNOME &version; relatively quickly, and to release new versions soon that include GNOME &version;.</para>

   <para>If you are brave and patient, and would like to build GNOME from source code to test the very latest versions and to provide feedback and improvements, we recommend a build tool such as the <ulink url="http://cipherfunk.org/garnome/">GARNOME</ulink> utility, for building from released tarballs, and <ulink url="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/jhbuild">jhbuild</ulink>, for building from CVS.</para>

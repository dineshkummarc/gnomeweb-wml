  <title>Panel Items</title>

  <para>
   GNOME &version; includes major improvements to its panel items (also known as applets), providing new features and better integration with the rest of the desktop.
  </para>
  <para>The most visible change is the removal of the Actions panel menu and the addition of Places and Desktop menus. These provide fast access to the items you use most often, without navigating through sub-menus. For instance, the Places menu lists your home folder, your computer, networked servers, and the search feature. In the Desktop menu, you'll find your Preferences and Administration control panels, Log Out, and Help.</para>

  <para>All of the panel menus are now defined by the cross-platform Freedesktop.org menu specification, so 3rd-party software may add itself to the Applications menu without even knowing about GNOME.</para>
 
  <para>
   Also, most applets can now be partly transparent, when the panel itself is transparent.
  </para>

  <title>Integrated Modem Control</title>
  <para>
   GNOME &version; introduces a new applet for controlling your Modem, integrated with GNOME System Tools.
  </para>

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-trash">
  <title>Panel Trashcan</title>

  <para>
   GNOME &version; features an optional trashcan for your Panel.
   Just like the trashcan on your desktop, you can now drag and drop files and other items into the trash
   without minimizing your open windows.
  </para>

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-drivemount">
  <title>Control Mounted Volumes</title>

  <para>
   GNOME 2.8 allowed you to easily mount your digital media, such as CDs, DVDs, and USB memory sticks.
   Now the volume mounter applet helps you to use these volumes without the difficulty of finding their icons on the desktop, behind 
   your open windows. The applet shows the currently mounted (or unmountable) volumes, allowing 
   you to mount them, eject them, or open them in the file manager.
  </para>

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-gweather">
  <title>Get even more weather</title>
  <para>
   The weather monitor can now show even more locations than before, and the 
   location names have been translated into non-English languages where appropriate.
   In addition, the forecast now includes sunrise and sunset calculations for most locations.
  </para>

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-mixer">
  <title>Sound control</title>
  <para>
   A new mixer for your panel (combined with a new-look mixer on the desktop)
   gets the most from your sound hardware. Using the GStreamer
   multimedia framework, the mixer is now simpler and more convenient than before. 
   The same multimedia framework powers Totem, Sound Juicer, the GNOME CD player 
   and a variety of third-party applications, so changing the GNOME volume 
   via the panel will change the volume of all these applications.
  </para>

  <sect3 id="rnapplets-stickynotes">
  <title>Taking note</title>
  <para>
   The popular Sticky Notes applet now makes it even easier to add PostIt-style notes on your desktop, thanks to a simpler user interface and many bug fixes. For instance, sticky notes will now stay on the correct workspace, or even a different monitor.
  </para>
  <para>And sticky notes now stay on top other windows, so you can't lose them. To hide the notes,
   simply use the applet's right-click menu. 
  </para>

  <sect3 id="rnapplet-cpufreq">
  <title>Specially for laptops</title>
  <para>
   GNOME now includes an applet to monitor your laptop's processor speed. The CPU
   Frequency Monitor watches variable-speed processors (such as those with 
   Intel Speedstep or AMD PowerNow) to show their current status. You may even choose 
   a different speed if you don't have automatic frequency scaling enabled.

  <sect3 id="rnapplet-removed">
  <title>Removed Applets</title>
  <para>
   Three applets were removed in GNOME &version;, replaced by better alternatives in most cases.
  </para>
  <para>
   The CD Player panel applet has been removed, so you will not see a CD player on your panel when you don't even have a CD in your drive. Instead, inserting a CD will now start the GNOME CD Player, which can then be controlled from a notification icon that it places in your Panel.
  </para>
  <para>
   The dedicated Wireless applet has been removed because the Network Monitor applet, introduced in GNOME 2.8, also includes wireless support.
  </para>
  <para>
   The Mailbox Monitor has been removed because it was unmaintained and
   insecure. We hope to have a solution integrated with our Evolution mail client in the
   future. If you don't use Evolution for your mail, you can use a third party
   application such as <ulink
   url="http://www.nongnu.org/mailnotify/">mailnotify</ulink>.

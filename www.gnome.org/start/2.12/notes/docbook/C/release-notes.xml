      <para>
The GNOME &version; Desktop is the latest release of the ever popular, multi-platform free desktop environment.</para>

      <para>The GNOME desktop releases continue to arrive on schedule. GNOME &version; includes a number of interesting new features and hundreds of bug fixes. This time GNOME also includes a video player and a CD-ripping utility. You can learn more in the following sections.</para>

    <para>GNOME provides a user-friendly environment that &quot;just works&quot;
    for everyday users, without excess complexity or obscure features. At the same
    time we provide the rich flexibility experienced developers
    demand.</para>

    <para>GNOME runs on a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux
    (commonly called Linux), Solaris, HP-UX, BSD and Apple's
    Darwin. GNOME includes powerful features such as world-class
    smooth text rendering, a first-class accessibility infrastructure,
    and a complete internationalization infrastructure that includes
    support for bi-directional text.</para>

    <para>Of course GNOME &version; includes all of the improvements made in
    GNOME &oldversion;, which you can learn about in the GNOME &oldversion; <ulink
    url="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.8/notes/">release notes</ulink>.</para>

    <para>The Desktop release contains all the applications needed
  to provide basic user functionality. Major applications
  such as <application>Gnumeric</application> and
  <application>OpenOffice.org</application> are also available, but are
  developed in parallel on their own release cycle rather than
  being included in the core GNOME release.</para>

    <para>GNOME is part of the GNU Project, and is <ulink
    url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
    software</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Please continue directly to the <link linkend="rnwhatsnew">What's New</link> section, 
    or use the links at the right to learn more about this release and the GNOME Desktop in general.</para>

    <title>Known Issues</title>
    <para>All software, when it is released, contains bugs the developers know
    about but have chosen, for a variety of reasons, not to fix before
    releasing. Free software is no different in this regard from proprietary
    software, except that with free software, we tell users about these problems.</para>

    <para>We also encourage our users to report bugs so that they can be
    fixed. The best way to report bugs found in GNOME is to use the <ulink
    url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/simple-bug-guide.cgi">Simple Bug
    Guide</ulink>. This will take you through the necessary steps to file a
    quality bug report, and make sure that it is tagged appropriately. If you're
    too advanced for anything with the word 'simple' in it, there is also the
    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi">traditional bug
    form</ulink>.

    More details on bugs already reported can be found at our <ulink
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">Bugzilla</ulink>. Among the
    most prominent GNOME &version; bugs:</para>

          new window focus</ulink>: When you launch Mozilla or Firefox and
          already have another Mozilla or Firefox window open, the new window
          may appear without focus and behind the window that does have focus.
          GNOME's mozilla-based Epiphany browser does not have this problem, and
          Mozilla hackers are working to quickly fix this in future versions of
          Mozilla and Firefox.</para>

          Session startup temporary hang</ulink>: Applications with broken
          session management can cause login to hang for a few minutes at the
          splashscreen.  The default session does not contain any such apps so
          this will only become a problem if you save your session on logout.
          If you run into this problem, just wait for the login to proceed and
          then remove any such applications before saving your session
          again.</para>

   <title>Looking to GNOME &nextversion; and Beyond</title>

        <para>GNOME operates on a time-based release philosophy, an
    attempt to continuously provide the best of our developers' efforts

    we anticipate that GNOME &nextversion; will feature more integrated
    multimedia and communication functionality and further advances in accessibility, usability and
    internationalization. See also the <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/RoadMap">GNOME roadmap</ulink>.</para>

  <para>GNOME's games put extra fun in the desktop. The Mines game has some improvements in GNOME &version; - for instance, the first click is guaranteed to clear a useful number of squares so you don't have to blindly click and hope you don't hit a mine, and an explosion graphic is drawn when you set off a mine.</para>

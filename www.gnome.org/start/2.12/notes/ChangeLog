	* docbook/C/release-notes.xml: Known Issues: Fixed a trailing in. This is a split
        infinitive or something like that. Looking Ahead: s/philosophy/schedule/.

2005-08-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docbook/C/release-notes.xml: Put Admin section before Developer section - 
        they are a larger audience and more the traditional audience for this 
        document.
	* docbook/C/rndevelopers.xml: Add title for windows section and mention that 
        GTK+ and co are already popular for cross-platform work.
	* docbook/C/rnusers.xml: Put Desktop section before the Applications. It is 
 	more fundamental.

	* docbook/C/release-notes.xml: Concisified some of the new text
	from Luis, though it was not too bad. The page needs either some GNOME 
	background or to stop promising to give GNOME background.

	* docbook/Makefile_shared.am_fragment: Commented-out uk temporarily, 
	because it is causing a build error, though the problem seems to be in 
	xml2po, which needs to be updated to a newer version.

	* docbook/C/rnapplications.xml:
	fix a couple comma problems

	* docbook/C/rndesktop.xml: 
	comma versus colon (I think colon is better--someone want to
	double check?), s/is now show/is now shown/
	
	* docbook/C/rngames.xml:
	Ahem, this is Gnome 2.12, not 2.4.  ;-)
	
	* docbook/C/rnplatform.xml:
	Remove an empty bulleted item, and fix an empty paragraph
	
	* docbook/C/rnutilities.xml:
	Remove unneeded and distracting comma.

2005-08-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docbook/C/rnapplications.xml: Added more evolution stuff 
	from my email to the evolution-hackers list, not all of 
	which I understand.

	* docbook/pa/figures/figure-controlpanel-aboutme.png:
	* docbook/sr/figures/figure-controlpanel-aboutme.png: 
	Added screenshots, because the build breaks if there are 
	none.

	* docbook/Makefile_shared.am_fragment:
	* docbook/fr/.cvsignore:

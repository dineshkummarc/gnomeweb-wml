<para>&quot;This GNOME release is exciting&quot;, says Christian Schaller, Fluendo Business Manager and GStreamer development team member.  &quot;Not only is GNOME fixing problems for end users, but by working actively with other free software communities like freedesktop.org, GStreamer, and GTK+, GNOME is driving forward the entire Free Software desktop.&quot;</para>

<para>&quot;We're having lots of fun doing this&quot;, said Luis Villa, GNOME Foundation Board member and contributor.  &quot;Instead of just talking about vaporware that takes years to come out, GNOME's developers are creating concrete improvements and delivering these to our users twice a year. This is something no proprietary desktop vendor matches.&quot;</para>

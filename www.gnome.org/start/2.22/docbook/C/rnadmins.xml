		<title>PolicyKit Integration</title>

		<para>
			PolicyKit is a new cross-desktop security framework. The purpose of
			PolicyKit is to provide a consistent way for user applications to gain
			extra privileges, e.g. for administrative applications.
		</para>
		<para>
			Using PolicyKit, Administrators can now configure system-wide settings.
			For example, you may allow some user to adjust the date and time of the
			clock or you might grant specific users the ability to start and stop
			system services.
		</para>

		<!-- FIXME: screenshot of privileges UI -->

		<para>
			For users, control panels now feature unlock buttons next to settings they
			are not currently authorized to change. Clicking on the unlock button will
			ask the user to provide extra authorization credentials.
		</para>

		<!-- FIXME: screenshot of one of these UIs and the unlock dialog -->

		<title>Better System Tools</title>

		<para>
			GNOME's system administration tools now monitor for changes in the
			configuration files they're editing. This means if another administrator
			changes the configuration, your display is updated to reflect this.
		</para>

		<para>
			The Share Administrator <!-- FIXME: is this the name? --> now allows you
			to edit the SMB user database (smbpasswd).
		</para>

		<para>
			The Network Administrator <!-- FIXME: same thing --> can now set up
			PPPoE and GPRS connections.
		</para>

		<title>Simplified Keyboard Settings</title>

		<para>
			The keyboard layout and keyboard accessibility preferences have been
			merged into one dialog, putting every keyboard setting you need in one
			place. Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts remain separate.
		</para>

		<!-- FIXME: screenshot of the two dialogs -->

	<title>Installing GNOME</title>

	<para>
		You can try out GNOME &gnomeversion; via the LiveCD which contains all of the software
		included in GNOME &gnomeversion; on a single CD. It can be downloaded from the GNOME
		<ulink url="http://torrent.gnome.org/">BitTorrent site</ulink>.
	</para>

	<para>
		To install or upgrade your machine to GNOME &gnomeversion;, we recommend you install
		official packages from your vendor or distribution. Popular distributions
		will make GNOME &gnomeversion; available very soon and some already have
		development versions with GNOME &gnomeversion; available. You can get a list of
		distributions who ship GNOME, and discover the latest versions they ship on our
		<ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/footware.shtml">Get Footware</ulink>
		page.
	</para>

	<para>
		If you are brave and patient and would like to build GNOME from source,
		we recommend you use one of the build tools.
		<ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/projects/garnome/">GARNOME</ulink> builds GNOME
		from release tarballs. You will need GARNOME &gnomeversion;.x to build GNOME &gnomeversion;.x.
		There is also <ulink
		url="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/jhbuild">jhbuild</ulink> which is
		designed to build the latest GNOME from svn. You can also use jhbuild to build
		GNOME &gnomeversion;.x by using the <filename>gnome-&gnomeversion;</filename> moduleset.
	</para>

  <para>
	  While it is possible to build GNOME directly from the release tarballs, we
		strongly recommend the use of one of the build tools above.

	<title>What's New For Users</title>
	
	<para>
			The GNOME Project's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME &gnomeversion;
			with its hundreds of bug fixes and user-requested improvements. The
			sheer number of enhancements make it impossible to list every change and
			improvement made but we hope to highlight some of the
			more exciting user-oriented features in this release of GNOME.

		<title>Say Cheese</title>

		<!-- FIXME: cheese screenshot -->
		<para>
			GNOME 2.22 introduces a new application,
			<application>Cheese</application>. Cheese lets you take photos and make
			videos using your computer's webcam apply a range of different effects
			(like XXX and XXX) that you can share with your friends, load into
			<application>F-Spot</application> or set as your account photo.

		<title>Window Compositing</title>

		<para>
			GNOME 2.22 introduces window compositing on capable platforms. Fitting
			with GNOME's "keeping it simple" policy, the features are very low key.
			The most noticable changes are drop shadows on windows, live previews when
			switching windows with Alt-Tab and transparency effects.
		</para>
		<para>
			Not all graphics hardware reliably supports compositing, so this feature
			is currently turned off by default. To enable it... XXX XXX.

			Also appearing in 2.22 are a selection of new plugins, including support

		<title>International Clock</title>

		<para>
			No need to do any more mental arithmatic to work out what time your
			teleconference starts in Sydney, GNOME 2.22 now has internationalisation
			built into its clock. Add locations from around the world to see the local
			time and weather.

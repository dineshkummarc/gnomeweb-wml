	<title>What's New For Users</title>
	
	<para>
			The GNOME Project's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME &gnomeversion;
			with its hundreds of bug fixes and user-requested improvements. The
			sheer number of enhancements make it impossible to list every change and
			improvement made but we hope to highlight some of the
			more exciting user-oriented features in this release of GNOME.

		<title>Say Cheese</title>

		<!-- FIXME: cheese screenshot -->
		<para>
			GNOME 2.22 introduces a new application,
			<application>Cheese</application>. Cheese lets you take photos and make
			videos using your computer's webcam apply a range of different effects
			(like XXX and XXX) that you can share with your friends, load into
			<application>F-Spot</application> or set as your account photo.

	<sect2 id="sect:metacity">
		<title>Window Compositing</title>

		<para>
			GNOME 2.22 introduces window compositing on capable platforms. Fitting
			with GNOME's "keeping it simple" policy, the features are very low key.
			The most noticable changes are drop shadows on windows, live previews when
			switching windows with Alt-Tab and transparency effects.
		</para>
		<para>
			Not all graphics hardware reliably supports compositing, so this feature
			is currently turned off by default. To enable it... XXX XXX.

		<title>International Clock</title>

		<para>
			No need to do any more mental arithmatic to work out what time your
			teleconference starts in Sydney, GNOME 2.22 now has internationalisation
			built into its clock. Add locations from around the world to see the local
			time and weather.

		<title>Continual Evolution</title>

			<application>Evolution</application> continues to be improved
			with new support for Google Calendars and custom message labels (tagging)
			for your email.
		</para>

		<!-- FIXME: Evolution Google Calendars screenshot -->

		<para>
			Work has also gone into improving the speed of spam filtering and making
			error dialogs less intrusive on your desktop session by using the status
			bar rather than popups.
		</para>
	</sect2>

	<sect2 id="sect:vinagre">
		<title>VNC Client</title>

		<para>
			New in GNOME 2.22 is the <application>Remote Desktop Viewer</application>.
			This application complements the existing remote desktop server
			support in GNOME, it features the ability to discover machines on the
			local network and bookmark your favourites.
		</para>

		<!-- FIXME: vinagre screenshot -->

		<para>
			Users desiring more control over the remove desktop server will also
			appreciate the addition of an <guilabel>Advanced</guilabel> tab in the
			properties dialog.

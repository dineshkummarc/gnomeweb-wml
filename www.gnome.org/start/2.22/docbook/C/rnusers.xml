	<para>
			The GNOME Project's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME &gnomeversion;
			with its hundreds of bug fixes and user-requested improvements. The
			sheer number of enhancements make it impossible to list every change and
			improvement made but we hope to highlight some of the
			more exciting user-oriented features in this release of GNOME.

	  Raphael Higino was a long time contributor to GNOME's Brazillian translation
		effort and was very passionate about GNOME. He was a very dependable member
		of the team and was always willing to lend a guiding hand to new
		contributors and he had made a number of very good friends in the community.
		Raphael passed away last year in a motorcycle accident at only 24 years of
		age. His dedication, hard work and companionship will always be cherished by
		the community and all those whose lives he touched.

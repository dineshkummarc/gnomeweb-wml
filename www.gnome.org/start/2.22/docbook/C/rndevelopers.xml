	<title>What's New For Developers</title>

	<para>
		The GNOME &gnomeversion; Developers' Platform provides a stable base for independent
		software developers to create third-party applications. GNOME and its
		platform are licensed to allow the creation of both free and proprietary
		software to run on top of GNOME.
	</para>

	<para>
		Libraries in the GNOME Platform are guaranteed to be API and ABI stable for
		the rest of the GNOME 2.x release series. Libraries in the GNOME Desktop do
		not have this guarantee, but most remain consistent from release to release.

  <title>GNOME 2.18 (Simply Beautiful)</title>

  <para>GNOME 2.18 is out, on time as usual. The top-class free desktop for the
  masses looks and feels better than ever. This is another progressive release
  in our road to perfection. It integrates another load of improvements done in
  the visual design, the performance of the desktop components, and the growing
  collection of integrated applications. The web browser and the themeable window
  manager are two good examples to check.</para>

  <para>Personal security is now fully integrated into the desktop, allowing
  digitally signed communications, encryption of emails and local files, and
  user-friendly management of personal keys. Internationalization records
  progress in all directions, with support for vertical text layout and a full
  Arabic localization matching the quality standards. The official release
  incorporates essential tools for developers, which hopefully will contribute
  to get more and better software for the GNOME users.</para>

  <para>What's more important, for the first time we ship online games, chess
  with a 3D look, and endless Sudoku entertainment.</para>

  <para>The GNOME desktop is distributed through free and commercial operating
  systems including Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, OpenSolaris, RedHat, SLED and Ubuntu.
  GNOME is also present inside XO (the One Laptop Per Child device) and an increasing
  collection of mobile devices. Users can already get their hands on GNOME 2.18
  trying our official live demos or the testing versions released by some
  distributions. Check the <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/~davyd/footware.shtml">Get

    <title>About GNOME</title>

    <para>We produce free software that makes computers friendly, useful, and
    fun. We provide a graphical environment that is easy to use, a set of
    integrated programs, and tools to develop and maintain your own applications.</para>

    <para>GNOME is available in dozens of languages. It is compatible with multiple
    operating systems. It works on home computers, laptops, mobile devices,
    supercomputers, and small embedded appliances. You can find GNOME across the
    world in homes, schools, offices, and probably also in your neighborhood.</para>

    <para>GNOME has won a reputation for its simplicity and ease of use. We love
    software that just works: logical, clean, intuitive, and full of sense.
    Attention to detail is always appreciated: we polish interfaces as well as
    internal processes, in a constant search for beauty and integration.</para>

    <para>The coordination of this large project relies on the GNOME Foundation,
    an open organization formed by volunteers, professionals and companies.</para>

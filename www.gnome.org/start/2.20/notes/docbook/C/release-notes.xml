				GNOME &gnomeversion; is the latest version of the GNOME Desktop: a popular,
				multi-platform desktop environment. GNOME's focus is ease of use, 
				stability, and first class internationalization and accessibility support. 
				Based on Free and Open Source Software, GNOME provides all of the common tools 
				computer users expect of a modern computing environment, as well as a flexible and
				powerful platform for software developers.
			</para>

      <!-- Update this summary for each new version: -->
			<para>
				The improvements in GNOME &gnomeversion; include: desktop search integrated into the file 
				chooser dialog; convenient new features in the Evolution email and calendar client; enhanced 
				browsing of image collections; simplified system preferences; efficient power management and 
				incredibly accurate laptop battery monitoring. Developers receive more help with application development 
				thanks to a new version of the GTK+ toolkit, improved tools, and a great new documentation web site.

				The GNOME Desktop is released every six months with many new features,
				improvements, "bug" fixes and translations, and GNOME &gnomeversion; continues this
				tradition. To learn more about GNOME and the qualities that
				distinguish it from other computer desktop environments (like usability,
				accessibility, internationalization and freedom) visit the
				<ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/about">About GNOME</ulink> page on our
				website.

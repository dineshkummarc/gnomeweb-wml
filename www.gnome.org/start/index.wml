So you've seen it, and now you want it? Well, this is the right place. You
have two major options, which one to choose depends on your current setup and
your skill level:
<p>
<font size="+2" color="#400000"><b>Binary packages:</b></font><br>
<p>This is the easiest option. If you just want it to work, right now, this is
for you.</p>

<p>If you run Linux or Solaris, go on over to 
<a href="http://www.ximian.com/download/">Ximian</a> and
see if your operating system and/or distribution is supported. If so,
grab their fresh packages, optionally using the extremely friendly
installer.</p>

<p>Solaris users can also grab GNOME directly from <a href="http://www.sun.com/gnome/">Sun</a>.</p>

<p>IRIX users can download GNOME from <a href="http://freeware.sgi.com/">SGI</a>.</p>

<p>AIX users can get GNOME from <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/ezinstall.html">IBM</a>.</p>

<p>
<font size="+2" color="#400000"><b>Source code:</b></font><br>
<p>Your distribution wasn't on the list above? Or you just want more control,
and build the packages from source yourself? Not a problem. There's a <a
href="source.html">whole page</a> just about how to get GNOME sources.</p>

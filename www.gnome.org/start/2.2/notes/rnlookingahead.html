    popularity of the GNOME 2.0 developer platform, and our quick
    release cycle for GNOME 2.2.0 have stimulated great interest
    not only in GNOME 2.2 but in the next release of the GNOME Desktop
    and Developer Platform.
    </p><p>Over the last couple of months, there has been a huge amount
of activity at the application level. GNOME 2.4 will continue to
benefit from this activity, as we merge many of these newly developed
and ported applications together. You can find many of these
applications at the <a href="http://5toe.lyrical.net/" target="_top">5th Toe
website</a>. Major software releases based on the GNOME 2.2
Developer Platform are expected in the next several months, including
Ximian's powerful Evolution personal information manager, the popular
Galeon web browser, and Gnumeric and Abiword, two of the leading Free
Software office tools. In addition, a large number of smaller apps
will continue to provide a rich and usable environment for GNOME
users.</p><p>
GNOME 2.4 will continue GNOME 2.2's movement towards a more tightly
integrated desktop, making it a real competitor at the enterprise
level. This next release - expected in the late (northern) summer of 2003 - should
offer several mature productivity applications, utilities and
accessories so that a GNOME user will never have to leave a simple,
clean, powerful GNOME application.
</p><p>
Six months after GNOME 2.4, we anticipate that GNOME 2.6 will feature
the next release of GTK+, introducing new file selector and
&quot;combo&quot; widgets, powerful menu and toolbar widgets and
further advances in accessibility, usability and internationalization.

    version of the popular, multi-platform free desktop environment. GNOME runs on a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux (commonly
    called Linux), Solaris, HP-UX, BSD and Apple's Darwin. GNOME includes
    powerful features such as high-quality smooth text rendering and first class
    internationalization and accessibility support, including support for
    bi-directional text. The GNOME community has spent the six months since the GNOME
    2.0 release improving usability, performance, appearance, and
    accessibility support. We also added new functionality, including
    new applications, producing a feature-rich GNOME 2.2
    desktop. GNOME provides a user-friendly environment that &quot;just works&quot;
    for everyday users, without excess complexity, while at the same
    time providing the rich flexibility experienced developers
    demand. We have tried to avoid unnecessary complications or
    obscure features, sticking instead to a clear, unified
    vision. The GNOME 2 developer platform has matured and is now widely
    used by applications outside of the GNOME core. While GNOME 2.0
    was a major upgrade to the underlying platform, GNOME 2.2.0 is
    a simpler time-based release that includes a number of improvements
    that have been completed since the previous release. In the future you
    can look forward to further enhancements from regularly scheduled
    GNOME releases. Most major GNOME-based applications have been ported to
    GNOME 2, and the new platform has allowed the development of
    several new applications. We encourage developers to use the GNOME
    2.2 platform and take advantage of its features. Of course GNOME 2.2 includes all of the improvements made in
    GNOME 2.0, which you can learn about here. The Desktop and Platform release does not include large applications
      such as Gnumeric; those are developed in
      parallel on their own natural release cycle. GNOME is part of the GNU Project, and is free
    software."><link rel="home" href="index.html" title="GNOME 2.2.0 Release Notes"><link rel="next" href="rnwhatsnew.html" title="What's New In GNOME 2.2"></head><body bgcolor="white" text="black" link="#0000FF" vlink="#840084" alink="#0000FF"><div class="navheader"><table width="100%" summary="Navigation header"><tr><th colspan="3" align="center">GNOME 2.2.0 Release Notes</th></tr><tr><td width="20%" align="left"> </td><th width="60%" align="center"> </th><td width="20%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="rnwhatsnew.html">Next</a></td></tr></table></div><IMG src="../figures/smallfoot.png"><div class="article" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h1 class="title"><a name="index"></a>GNOME 2.2.0 Release Notes</h1></div><div><div class="abstract"><p class="title"><b>Introduction</b></p><p>The GNOME 2.2.0 Desktop and Platform release is the latest

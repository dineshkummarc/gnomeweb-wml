		The GNOME 2.14 Developer's Platform provides a stable base for independant
		software developers to create third-party applications. GNOME and its
		platform are licensed to allow the creation of both free and propriortary
		software to run on top of GNOME.
	</para>

	<para>
		Libraries in the GNOME Platform are guarenteed to be API and ABI stable for
		the rest of the GNOME 2.x release series. Libraries in GNOME Desktop do not
		have this guarentee, but most remain consistant from release to release.

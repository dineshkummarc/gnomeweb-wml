	<title>What's New For Administrators</title>

	<para>
		As of GNOME 2.14, the GNOME Project now includes the GNOME Administration
		Suite, a collection of tools that are aimed squarely at systems
		administrators. The two new tools that form the beginnings of this suite are
		incredibly powerful and should help administrators in both large corporate
		deployments and situations where machine lockdown is required.

	<title>What's New For Administrators</title>

	<para>
		As of GNOME 2.14, the GNOME Project now includes the GNOME Administration
		Suite, a collection of tools that are aimed squarely at systems
		administrators. The two new tools that form the beginnings of this suite are
		incredibly powerful and should help administrators in both large corporate
		deployments and situations where machine lockdown is required.

		<title>Sabayon - Profile Editor</title>

		<para>
			Sabayon allows administrators to set up user profiles inside a live,
			interactive GNOME session. When the administrator chooses to create or
			edit a profile, a nested GNOME session is started up that the
			administrator can use to change anything they could change in their own
			GNOME session.

		<para>
			Sabayon will track changes to both files and GConf settings.
			The administrator can then choose to remove accidental changes or make
			other changes mandatory rather than optional (eg. lockdown settings or
			proxy settings).
			Once complete, the administrator can package up these profiles and deploy
			them to machines.
		</para>

		<para>
			Users or groups (???) are placed into profiles which will be used when
			they log into their GNOME session. Being able to easily create multiple
			profiles and allocate each user separately allows users to have different
			setups based on their job description (eg. receptionist, data entry clerk,
			programmer, human resources manager, etc.).

		<title>Pessulus - Lockdown Editor</title>

		<para>
			Pessulus is a lockdown editor that allows administrators of corporate
			environments, Internet cafes and other computing environments to disable
			certain features of the GNOME desktop.

	<title>What's New For Users</title>
	
	<para>
		GNOME focuses on users and usability, and with
		GNOME 2.14 including hundreds of bugfixes and user-requested improvements,
		it would be impossible to list every single change and improvement we made.
		This page hopes to highlight some of the more exciting user-oriented
		features in this release of GNOME.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-performance">
		<title>Performance Improvements</title>

		<para>
			Just as you would tune your car, our skilled engineers have strived
			to tune many parts of GNOME to be as fast as possible. Several important
			components of the GNOME desktop are now measurably faster, including
			font renderering, memory allocation and numerous individual applications.
			Faster font rendering and faster memory allocation benefit all GNOME and
			GTK+ applications without the need to even recompile them.
		</para>

		<para>
			Some applications have received special attention to make sure they are
			performing at their peak. GNOME Terminal, the terminal emulator for the
			GNOME desktop, has been optimised in several ways so that it is faster
			and, at the same time, more resource efficient.
			The GNOME
			Log Viewer now starts up over 20 times faster than ever before.
		</para>

			The GNOME file manager, Nautilus, now offers powerful search interface
			available by pressing <shortcut>Ctrl-F</shortcut> on the desktop or a file
			manager window.

			advantage of it for faster, more contexual searching.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-yelp">
		<title>More Help</title>

		<para>
			The GNOME help browser also includes new features for searching help and
			documentation installed on your machine. Now with access to both GNU Info
			and traditional UNIX manpages, as well as GNOME's high quality
			documentation, it is possible to search most of the documentation included
			on your system quite rapidly.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-ekiga">
		<title>Ekiga</title>

		<para>
			Ekiga, formerly known as GNOME Meeting is GNOME's voice and video over IP
			client. Ekiga supports both the SIP protocol, used in Google Talk,
			Asterisk and many other software and hardware VoIP devices; and H323, an
			older communications protocol used in Microsoft Netmeeting and some
			telecomms hardware.
		</para>

		<para>
			Ekiga also features STUN support to allow traversal through many types of
			firewalls, including Network Address Translating (NAT) firewalls. This
			means that you can use Ekiga to make and receive calls without having a
			public IP address or forwarding ports from your router.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-metacity">
		<title>Improved Window Management</title>

		<para>
			Several new features have been added to Metacity to improve window
			management. Window edges now have a magnetic attraction, making it
			possible to "click" windows together. Multiple monitor (head) handling has
			been improved in Metacity. Metacity will now attempt to displace windows
			that want to appear across a monitor boundry onto one monitor or the
			other.
		</para>

		<para>
			To help administrators and users of multiple machines from the same X
			server, Metacity will now give the hostname of windows not running locally
			in the title bar. This is especially useful when changing settings on
			machines graphically to ensure that you're making changes on the correct
			machine.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-deskbar">
		<title>Deskbar</title>
		<para>
			New to GNOME is the Deskbar. Power users, keyboard enthusiasts and users
			of the old panel command line will find this replacement incredibly
			powerful and easy to use. Deskbar uses plugins (written in Python) to
			provide search functionality for programs, files, folders, bookmarks,
			contacts and much more. Deskbar can also use the live search functionality
			of Google Live, Yahoo and Beagle.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-fusa">
		<title>Fast User Switching</title>
		<para>

		<title>Smarter Bookmarking</title>

		<para>
			The Epiphany Web Browser continues to make browsing the world wide web
			easier.
			New in this release is the automatic construction of bookmark hierarchies.
			This reduces the burden of handling large bookmark collections, but
			retains the simpler topic-based system of bookmark management popular in
			Epiphany. Topics are now much easier to select and and create;
			Epiphany will even suggest topics based on past usage.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-gedit">
		<title>Better Editor</title>

		<para>
			Gedit continues to provide the usability of a simple text editor with all
			the features you need to develop applications or websites. Features in
			Gedit 2.14 include improved handling of multiple documents and writing to
			remote files. Combine this with browsing of SFTP, FTP and WebDAV
			directories directly from the file browser, plus syntax highlighting of
			HTML, PHP, PSP and more, and creating personal and business websites is
			now a piece of cake for anyone.

		<title>Integrated Screensaver</title>
		
		<para>
			GNOME now features an intergrated screensaver. GNOME Screensaver is
			compatible with the "hacks" popular in Xscreensaver, but also has lots of
			new features unavailable in Xscreensaver. Applications that are aware of
			GNOME Screensaver will be able to communicate with it to set properties
			like "do not blank screen" over a standard interface. Dialogs such as the
			unlock screen dialog are now translatable into your native language and
			accessible to users with disabilities that may prevent them from otherwise
			being able to unlock the display.

		<para>
			GNOME 2.14 utilises the technology of <application>GStreamer
			0.10</application>. The GStreamer multimedia framework is a powerful,
			pluggable audio and video framework used on Linux and UNIX desktops as
			well as in embedded devices and much more. This latest major version of
			GStreamer is faster and more stable than any of the preceeding versions.
			Issues like syncronisation of audio and video across different devices has
			been addressed, as has threading and the dynamic handling of multimedia
			plugins. You can find out more from the
			<ulink url="http://www.gstreamer.org/">GStreamer website</ulink>.
		</para>

		<para>
			All of the multimedia applications that ship with GNOME have been upgraded
			to take advantage of the latest GStreamer; including Totem, Sound Juicer
			and the volume controls.
		</para>

		<para>
			GStreamer 0.10 will also allow users to take advantage of multimedia
			plugins distributed by 3rd party vendors to offer support for licensed
			codecs that where no free codec is available. These may include support
			for AC3, WMA, MP3 and more. A licensed, yet freely available MP3 plugin
			for GStreamer 0.10 is being made available by

	<title>What's New For Users</title>
	
	<para>
			The GNOME Project's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME 2.14
			with it's hundreds of bug fixes and user-requested improvements. But the
			shear number of enhancements make it impossible to list every change and
			improvement that have been made. This page hopes to highlight some of the
			more exciting user-oriented features in this release of GNOME.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-performance">
		<title>Performance Improvements</title>

		<para>
			Just as you would tune your car, our skilled engineers have strived
			to tune many parts of GNOME to be as fast as possible. Several important
			components of the GNOME desktop are now measurably faster, including
			text rendering, memory allocation and numerous individual applications.
			Faster font rendering and memory allocation benefit all GNOME and
			GTK+ based applications without the need for recompilation.
		</para>

		<para>
			Some applications have received special attention to make sure they are
			performing at their peak. GNOME Terminal, the terminal emulator for the
			GNOME desktop, has been optimized in several ways to make it  faster
			and, at the same time, more resource efficient.
			The GNOME
			Log Viewer now starts up over 20 times faster than before.

			available by pressing <shortcut>Ctrl-F</shortcut> on the desktop or in a file
			manager window.

			advantage of it for faster, more contextual searching.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-yelp">
		<title>More Help</title>

		<para>
			The GNOME help browser also includes new features for searching help and
			documentation installed on your machine. Now with access to both GNU Info
			and traditional UNIX manpages, as well as GNOME's high quality
			documentation, it is possible to search most of the documentation included
			on your system quite rapidly.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-ekiga">
		<title>Ekiga</title>

		<para>
			Ekiga, formerly known as GNOME Meeting is GNOME's voice and video-over-IP
			client. Ekiga supports both the SIP and H323 protocols.
			SIP, a popular protocol used in Google Talk,
			Asterisk and many other software and hardware VoIP devices, is a recent
			addition to Ekiga. H323 is an
			older communications protocol, used in Microsoft Netmeeting and some
			telecommunications hardware.
		</para>

		<para>
			Ekiga also features STUN support to allow traversal through many types of
			firewalls, including Network Address Translating (NAT) firewalls. This
			means that you can use Ekiga to make and receive calls without having a
			public IP address or forwarding ports from your router.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-metacity">
		<title>Improved Window Management</title>

		<para>
			Several new features have been added to Metacity to improve window
			management. Window edges now have a magnetic attraction, making it
			possible to "click" windows together. Multiple monitor (head) handling has
			been improved in Metacity. Metacity will now attempt to displace windows
			that want to appear across a monitor boundary onto one monitor or the
			other.
		</para>

		<para>
			To help administrators and users of multiple machines from the same X
			server, the hostname of windows which are not running locally
			will be displayed in the title bar.
			This is especially useful when changing settings on
			machines graphically to ensure that you're making changes on the correct
			machine.

		<title>Deskbar</title>
		<para>
			New to GNOME is the Deskbar. Power users, keyboard enthusiasts and users
			of the old panel command line will find this replacement incredibly
			powerful and easy to use. Deskbar uses plugins (written in Python) to
			provide search functionality for programs, files, folders, bookmarks,
			contacts and much more. Deskbar can also use the live search functionality
			of Google Live, Yahoo and Beagle.

			The Epiphany Web Browser continues to make browsing the world wide web
			easier.
			New in this release is the automatic construction of bookmark hierarchies.
			This reduces the burden of handling large bookmark collections, but
			retains the simpler topic-based system of bookmark management popular in
			Epiphany. Topics are now much easier to select and create;
			Epiphany will even suggest topics based on past usage.

	<sect2 id="rnusers-gedit">
		<title>Better Editor</title>

		<para>
			Gedit continues to provide the usability of a simple text editor with all
			the features you need to develop applications or websites. Features in
			Gedit 2.14 include improved handling of multiple documents and writing to
			remote files. For example Gedit now allows for the seamless browsing and
			editing of SFTP, FTP and WebDAV directories directly from the file browser.
			It also has improved syntax highlighting of HTML, PHP, PSP and much more.
			These features combine to make Gedit a powerful text editor that can handle
			all the tasks that users require.

		<para>
			GNOME now features an integrated screensaver. GNOME Screensaver is
			compatible with the "hacks" popular in Xscreensaver, but also has lots of
			new features unavailable in Xscreensaver. Applications that are aware of
			GNOME Screensaver will be able to communicate with it to set properties
			like "do not blank screen" over a standard interface. Dialogs such as the
			unlock screen dialog are now translatable into native languages and
			accessible to users with disabilities. These accessibilty enhancements
			allow users with disabilities to easily unlock their displays and are part
			of the on going accessibilty improvements being made to the entire GNOME

	<sect2 id="rnusers-gstreamer">
		<title>Latest GStreamer</title>
		<para>
			GNOME 2.14 utilizes the technology of <application>GStreamer
			0.10</application>. The GStreamer multimedia framework is a powerful,
			pluggable audio and video framework used on Linux and UNIX desktops as
			well as in embedded devices. This latest major version of GStreamer is
			faster and more stable than its predecessors. Issues like synchronization
			of audio and video across different devices has been addressed, as has
			threading and the dynamic handling of multimedia plugins. You can find out
			more about GStreamer from the <ulink url="http://www.gstreamer.org/">GStreamer website</ulink>.
		</para>

		<para>
			All of the multimedia applications that ship with GNOME have been upgraded
			to take advantage of the latest GStreamer; including Totem, Sound Juicer
			and Volume Control.
		</para>

		<para>
			GStreamer 0.10 will also allow users to take advantage of multimedia
			plugins distributed by 3rd party vendors. This will allow vendors to
			offer support for licensed codecs where a free codec is not available
			or distributable (for legal reasons). These may include support
			for AC3, WMA, MP3 and more. A licensed, yet freely available MP3 plugin
			for GStreamer 0.10 is already being made available by

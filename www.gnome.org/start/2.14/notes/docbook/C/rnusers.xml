		<title>Performance Improvements</title>

		<para>
			Just as you would tune your car, GNOME's skilled engineers have worked
			hard to tune many parts of GNOME to be as fast as possible. Several
			important parts of the GNOME desktop are now measurably faster including
			font renderering, memory allocation and numerous individual applications.
			Faster font rendering and faster memory allocation for structures like
			list elements allows all GNOME and GTK+ applications to run faster without
			recompiling the application.
		</para>

		<para>
			Some applications have received special attention to make sure they are
			performing at their peak. GNOME Terminal, the terminal emulator for GNOME
			has been optimised so that it is faster and more resource efficent; not
			wasting valuable processessing time for updates you will never see on the
			screen.

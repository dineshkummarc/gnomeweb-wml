DESCRIPTION:Tarballs are due on 2008-12-15 before 23:59 UTC for the 
 GNOME 2.25.3 unstable release\, which will be delivered on 
 Wednesday. Modules which were proposed for inclusion should try to 
 follow the unstable schedule so everyone can test them.  Please make 
 sure that your tarballs will be uploaded before Monday 23:59 UTC: 
 tarballs uploaded later than that will probably be too late to get in 
 2.25.3. If you are not able to make a tarball before this deadline or if 
 you think you'll be late\, please send a mail to the release team 
 and we'll find someone to roll the tarball for you!

DESCRIPTION:No string changes may be made without confirmation from the 
 i18n team and notification to release team\, translation team\, and 
 documentation team. From this point\, developers can concentrate on 
 stability and bug-fixing. Translators can work without worrying that the 
 original English strings will change\, and documentation writers can take 
 accurate screenshots. For the string freezes explained\, and to see 
 which kind of changes are not covered by freeze rules\, check http:

 \"Functionality\" or \"Ability\". Bug fixes of existing features are not 
 affected.  This allows developers to concentrate on refining the new 
 features instead of adding yet more functionality.

DESCRIPTION:No API or ABI changes should be made in the platform 
 libraries. For instance\, no new functions\, no changed function 
 signatures or struct fields.  This provides a stable development 
 platform for the rest of the schedule.  There should usually be a 
 \"Slushy\" API/ABI Freeze before the Hard API/ABI Freeze\, to encourage 
 developers to think about API problems while they have a chance to 
 correct them.  API freeze is not required for non-platform libraries\, 
 but is recommended.

DESCRIPTION:Tarballs are due on 2009-03-02 before 23:59 UTC for the 
 GNOME 2.25.92 rc release\, which will be delivered on 
 Wednesday. Modules which were proposed for inclusion should try to 
 follow the unstable schedule so everyone can test them.  Please make 
 sure that your tarballs will be uploaded before Monday 23:59 UTC: 
 tarballs uploaded later than that will probably be too late to get in 
 2.25.92. If you are not able to make a tarball before this deadline 
 or if you think you'll be late\, please send a mail to the release team 
 and we'll find someone to roll the tarball for you!

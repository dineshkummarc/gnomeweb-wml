 major feature additions are listed. No new modules or features will be 
 accepted for this release period. \"Feature\" should be interpreted as 
 \"Functionality\" or \"Ability\". Bug fixes of existing features are not 
 affected.\n\nThis allows developers to concentrate on refining the new 
 features instead of adding yet more functionality.

 stability and bug-fixing. Translators can work without worrying that the 
 original English strings will change\, and documentation writers can take 
 accurate screenshots.\nFor the string freezes explained\, and to see 
 which kind of changes are not covered by freeze rules\, check http:

DESCRIPTION:No API or ABI changes should be made in the platform 
 libraries. For instance\, no new functions\, no changed function 
 signatures or struct fields.\n\nThis provides a stable development 
 platform for the rest of the schedule.\n\nThere should usually be a 
 \"Slushy\" API/ABI Freeze before the Hard API/ABI Freeze\, to encourage 
 developers to think about API problems while they have a chance to 
 correct them.\n\nAPI freeze is not required for non-platform libraries\, 
 but is recommended.

DESCRIPTION:No API or ABI changes should be made in the platform libraries
 . For instance\, no new functions\, no changed function signatures or stru
 ct fields.\n\nThis provides a stable development platform for the rest of 
 the schedule.\n\nThere should usually be a "Slushy" API/ABI Freeze before 
 the Hard API/ABI Freeze\, to encourage developers to think about API probl
 ems while they have a chance to correct them.\n\nAPI freeze is not require
 d for non-platform libraries\, but is recommended.

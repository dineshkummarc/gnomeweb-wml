<a name="rnwhy"></a>6. So, why GNOME?</h2>
<p>
  Having seen some of the new features in GNOME 2.4, why choose GNOME
  over other desktop environments? Every GNOME volunteer has their own
  motivations, of course, but here are some of the common reasons many
  of us choose to work on and use GNOME.

<a name="rnwhy-usability"></a>6.1. Usability</h3></div></div>
<p>
        GNOME is the only open source desktop projects to take a stand
    for ease of use and UI consistency over feature creep and
    hyper-configurability.  Our <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/" target="_top"> Human
    Interface Guidelines</a>, developed by a team of GNOME
    volunteers and UI professionals, and released before GNOME 2.0,
    are the most complete Free Software usability guidelines in
    existence. Every application in the GNOME Desktop release has
    benefited from this focus on consistency and usability. We believe
    that this focus will produce a user environment that "just works"
    and as a result lets GNOME users- both experienced and
    inexperienced- focus on doing real work instead of

<a name="rnwhy-accessibility"></a>6.2. Accessibility</h3></div></div>
<p>
      Beyond making GNOME easier to use for the average computer user,
          GNOME has also taken the lead in making the Unix desktop
          accessible to those with disabilities. In GNOME 2.4, the
          accessibility framework that debuted in GNOME 2.0 has been
          joined by award-winning accessibility tools like the GNOME
          Onscreen Keyboard (gok) and Gnopernicus, which allows for
          the use of braille readers, voice synthesizers, and pointing
          devices. Many governments, including the US government,
          require comprehensive accessibility support in software they
          purchase. After dozens of person-years of effort, GNOME is
          the only free software desktop to address this issue.

<a name="rnwhy-interface"></a>6.3. Interface Stability</h3></div></div>
<p>
       The key libraries in the GNOME Development Platform carry
       guarantees of API and ABI stability. This means that 'porting'
       an application from GNOME 2.0 to GNOME 2.4 
       involves exactly nothing, if a developer does not wish to
       take advantage of new functionality in the libraries.

<a name="rnwhy-mature"></a>6.4. Platform of Choice</h3></div></div>
<p>
          Popular and robust Free Software applications such as
          Mozilla, Eclipse, Evolution, Gnumeric, Abiword, GAIM,
          X-Chat, and more are based on GNOME or GTK+. These
          applications are among the most powerful and capable in the
          Free Software world, and we expect that they'll only get
          better as they take more advantage of the GNOME development
          environment. In addition, other important desktop projects,
          like Mono, Java, and OpenOffice.org, are working on
          integrating with GNOME and GTK+.

<p>
      GNOME 2.4 is the second 'time-based' GNOME release. Because
      GNOME releases on a regular schedule, contributors know that
      their contributions will be in a stable release and on the
      desktops of users everywhere within a short, predictable period
      after they contribute. In addition, people who want to deploy
      GNOME know that they can count on regular releases when they are
      planning rollouts or integration with their own products.
    </p>
<p>
      Additionally, the GNOME Foundation allows companies to support
      GNOME, while at the same time ensuring the independence of the
      board by ensuring that they are selected by the developers who
      work on GNOME. This infrastructure helps organize releases,
      sponsors the annual GUADEC conference, and the board hopes to
      extend that support to regular North American summits as well.

          All GNOME platform libraries are licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html" target="_top">LGPL</a> or similar
          license, so developing for the GNOME platform is 100% free of license
          fees, both for developers of Free and proprietary software.

<p>
          Besides the active GNOME community, many of the biggest
          supporters of the Unix desktop are GNOME contributors,
          including HP, MandrakeSoft, Novell (through Ximian), Red
          Hat, and Sun Microsystems.

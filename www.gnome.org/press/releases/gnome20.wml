<h1>GNOME 2.0 DESKTOP AND DEVELOPER PLATFORM RELEASED</h1>

<p>Latest version of the popular, multi-platform desktop environment boasts
simpler user interface and a host of powerful developer tools.</p>
		  
<p>OTTAWA, Canada  - June 26, 2002 - The GNOME Foundation today released
version 2.0 of the GNOME Desktop and Developer Platform at the Ottawa
Linux Symposium.  With the inclusion of GNOME 2.0 by leading Linux and
Unix vendors later this year, users of GNOME can look forward to an
improved user environment for existing GNOME applications, including a
faster and more powerful Nautilus file manager, features that are better
organized and usability-tested, dozens of useful utilities, applications
and even games.  Users and administrators will also see a new,
simplified configuration system. Developers can look forward to more
efficient application development with stronger integration of GNOME
APIs and the advantages of GNOME's component-based architecture.</p>

<p>"The GNOME 2.0 project is the culmination of a major effort which had
the dual objectives of dramatically improving developer productivity and
significantly enhancing the GNOME user experience," said Miguel de
Icaza, president of the GNOME Foundation and CTO and co-founder of
Ximian, Inc.  "The result is an elegant, new multi-platform desktop
environment for individual, corporate and government users worldwide."</p>

<p>GNOME is supported on a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux (more
commonly referred to as Linux), Solaris (tm) Operating Environment,
HP-UX, Unix, BSD and Apple's Darwin.  The enhanced user interface moves
from a traditional X Window System interface to one that is easy to use
and familiar to users of other environments.  The user interface also
boasts powerful features such as high-quality smooth text rendering and
first class internationalization support, including support for
bi-directional text.</p> 

<p>"Developing on the GNOME platform will take a leap forward with the
release of 2.0," said Havoc Pennington, GNOME Foundation board chair and
technical lead for desktop engineering at Red Hat, Inc.  "The
industrial-strength GTK+ 2.0 toolkit, combined with add-on tools such as
Glade, Python and our CORBA implementation make GNOME the natural choice
for developers on a variety of platforms.  GNOME's component-based
architecture makes it possible for developers to use already existing
tools, libraries and features, cutting development time significantly."</p>

<p>GNOME 2.0 has a host of advanced accessibility features for users with
disabilities and a built-in accessibility framework for developers to
meet Section 508 requirements.  Developers of GNOME 2.0 have devoted
thousands of man-hours to ensuring that GNOME will be accessible to
everyone, including people with disabilities.  More features and
enhanced accessibility capabilities will be added later this year.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.0 boasts some significant advances for developers, including an
enhanced GTK Toolkit, new libraries and widgets, as well as the
unparalleled advantages of GNOME's component-based architecture. 
GNOME's libraries are available for use in any application, without
fees, under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.0 is the first of the GNOME 2.x series.  Future releases will
bring more features to the core desktop, while adding GNOME 2 native
versions of popular applications such as Evolution, Galeon, Mozilla and
Gnumeric.</p>  

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>Developers and users wishing to install the GNOME 2.0 Desktop and
Developer Platform may freely download the software at www.gnome.org. 
The software includes the GNOME 2.0 desktop interface, file manager,
menus and utilities, as well as the complete set of development tools
and libraries.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.0 versions of popular applications will be available later this
year. GNOME 2.0 will be available later this year on the Solaris (tm)
Operating Environment, HP-UX and Red Hat Linux, as well as being
distributed by Ximian and other Linux distributions as part of their
offerings.</p>

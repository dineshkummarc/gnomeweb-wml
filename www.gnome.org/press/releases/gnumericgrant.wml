<h1>GNUMERIC PROJECT RECEIVES GRANT FROM OPEN SOURCE APPLICATIONS FOUNDATION</h1>

<p>Grant will be used to develop interoperability test suite</p>

<p>BOSTON, Mass. July 24, 2003 The GNOME Foundation  announced that the
Gnumeric project has received a grant from the Open Source Application
Foundation.  The $4,000 grant will be used to develop a test suite to
enhance interoperability between Gnumeric and other spreadsheet programs,
particularly the market leading spreadsheet program.   The goal of the grant
and test suite is to ensure that values and functions translate seamlessly
between proprietary and open source spreadsheet programs.  Funds from the
grant will be used to pay spreadsheet users to create files that test one or
several of the more than 350 functions available in the market-leading
proprietary spreadsheet software.</p>

<p>"This grant will be used to ensure that calculated values are the same
between spreadsheets created on the market leading proprietary program and
Gnumeric." said Jody Goldberg of Ximian, Inc., Gnumeric Project lead and
GNOME Foundation board member.  "The test suite that will be developed
through this grant will be available to all open source spreadsheet
programs."</p>

<p>Gnumeric is a free software spreadsheet program with better analytics than
the leading proprietary spreadsheet programs.  The project, which was
founded five years ago, is a leading open source spreadsheet program, and is
available on a number of popular open source desktop environments, including
GNOME.</p>

<p>"The availability of a strong set of interoperable productivity applications
is key to the success of Linux on the desktop," explained Mitch Kapor,
chairman of the Open Source Applications Foundation.  "Because of my
background in spreadsheets, I have a particular interest in open source
spreadsheet applications. I am therefore pleased to be able to make a small
contribution to strengthening not just the Gnumeric spreadsheet, but
interoperability among the different open source spreadsheet programs, and
compatibility with the leading commercial product.  We also hope that this
project will help build the community of volunteers contributing to these
projects, and lead to even closer collaboration between OpenOffice,
Gnumeric, Kspread and other open source spreadsheet projects."</p>

<p>The grant will give open source spreadsheet developers an invaluable testing
tool and will give Gnumeric users confidence that they have true
interoperability with other spreadsheets.</p>

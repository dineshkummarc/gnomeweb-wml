         GNOME 1.2 "Bongo GNOME" has been Unleashed!
                    Head for the Hills!


KING OF THE BONGO

    The GNOME team is proud to announce the availability of GNOME 1.2,
    affectionately known as "Bongo GNOME."  GNOME 1.2 is the latest
    stable release of the GNU desktop.
    
    This new release represents a dramatic step forward in the
    usability, attractiveness, and stability of the GNOME desktop.
    Since the release of October GNOME, the pace of development of new
    features and bugfixes in the GNOME project has more than doubled,
    and it would be impossible to name them all here.
    

GNOME 1.2 FOR USERS
 
    End users will be able to impress their grandparents and younger
    siblings with the following large-scale changes to the GNOME
    desktop:

  * Ease of use.  In response to feedback from our users, we
    formed the GNOME UI team, focused solely on improving the
    user experience.  The result is a lean, intuitive, and
    attractive desktop which just plain feels good.

  * Help.  Thanks to the relentless effort of the GNOME
    documentation team, on-line documentation and user's manuals
    are ubiquitous in GNOME 1.2.

  * Polish.  We corrected countless problems and bugs which
    users had reported in the previous version, and GNOME is
    more stable and smoother as a result.

  * Polyglot.  Updated localization and documentation from
    our international team of translators and writers.


GNOME 1.2 FOR HACKERS

    GNOME hackers and developers of GNOME applications now have a much
    more powerful development platform available to them:

  * Stability.  The same APIs you used in GNOME 1.0 are
    still available to you in GNOME 1.2.  We have worked hard to
    preserve source- and binary-compatibility everywhere.

  * Simplicity.  The Glade UI design tool has much improved
    support for GNOME, and is now an official part of the GNOME
    project.  Thanks to Glade, even the most inept programmers
    can construct beautiful user interfaces.  And
    non-programmers can contribute to the development process by
    designing interfaces which can be dropped wholesale into an
    existing project.

  * Power.  The robustness and utility of the GNOME libraries
    and development tools has been improved across the board.

  * Documentation.  The majority of the GNOME APIs are now fully
    documented.

  * Support.  The developer.gnome.org web site contains a
    wide variety of resources for those individuals and
    companies that use the GNOME development platform.

THE GNOME STEERING COMMITTEE

    At the first GNOME Users and Developers European Conference held
    in Paris, the GNOME steering committee was created to oversee the
    development of the GNOME 2.0 platform.  The committee will also
    help establish the GNOME Foundation which will be a non-profit
    organization that will insure GNOME's future as the world's
    leading free desktop.

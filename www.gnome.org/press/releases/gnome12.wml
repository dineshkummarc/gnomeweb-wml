<h1>GNOME 1.2 "Bongo GNOME" has been Unleashed! Head for the Hills!</h1>

<h3>KING OF THE BONGO</h3>

<p>The GNOME team is proud to announce the availability of GNOME 1.2,
affectionately known as "Bongo GNOME."  GNOME 1.2 is the latest
stable release of the GNU desktop.</p>

<p>This new release represents a dramatic step forward in the
usability, attractiveness, and stability of the GNOME desktop.
Since the release of October GNOME, the pace of development of new
features and bugfixes in the GNOME project has more than doubled,
and it would be impossible to name them all here.</p>
    
<h3>GNOME 1.2 FOR USERS</h3>
 
<p>End users will be able to impress their grandparents and younger
siblings with the following large-scale changes to the GNOME
desktop:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Ease of use.</b> In response to feedback from our users, we formed the GNOME UI 
team, focused solely on improving the user experience.  The result is a lean, 
intuitive, and attractive desktop which just plain feels good.

<li><b>Help.</b> Thanks to the relentless effort of the GNOME documentation team, on-line 
documentation and user's manuals are ubiquitous in GNOME 1.2.

<li><b>Polish.</b> We corrected countless problems and bugs which users had reported in 
the previous version, and GNOME is more stable and smoother as a result.

<li><b>Polyglot.</b> Updated localization and documentation from our international team 
of translators and writers.

<h3>GNOME 1.2 FOR HACKERS</h3>

<p>GNOME hackers and developers of GNOME applications now have a much more powerful 
development platform available to them:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Stability.</b> The same APIs you used in GNOME 1.0 are still available to you in GNOME 1.2. 
We have worked hard to preserve source- and binary-compatibility everywhere.

<li><b>Simplicity.</b> The Glade UI design tool has much improved support for GNOME, and is now an 
official part of the GNOME project.  Thanks to Glade, even the most inept programmers
can construct beautiful user interfaces.  And non-programmers can contribute to the 
development process by designing interfaces which can be dropped wholesale into an 
existing project.

<li><b>Power.</b> The robustness and utility of the GNOME libraries and development tools has 
been improved across the board.

<li><b>Documentation.</b> The majority of the GNOME APIs are now fully documented.

<li><b>Support.</b> The developer.gnome.org web site contains a wide variety of resources for 
those individuals and companies that use the GNOME development platform.
</ul>

<h1>THE GNOME AND LINUX COMMUNITIES AND INDUSTRY LEADERS JOIN TO CREATE THE
GNOME FOUNDATION</h1>

<p><i>Developers and Corporations Unite to Advance GNOME as the Leading Open
Source Desktop Environment</i></p>

<p>LinuxWorld Expo, San Jose, CA -- August 15, 2000 --The GNOME project today
announced the creation of the GNOME Foundation, which will be governed by a
board of directors elected by the hundreds of volunteer developers who
contribute to GNOME.  In addition, industry leaders and organizations including
Compaq, Eazel, Free Software Foundation, Gnumatic, Helix Code, Henzai,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Object Management Group, Red Hat, Sun Microsystems,
TurboLinux and VA Linux have announced their support for the foundation, with
the goal of advancing the availability of this easy-to-use, open source,
desktop environment.</p>

<p>"The GNOME Foundation marks a major step forward for the GNOME project,"
said Miguel de Icaza, founder of the GNOME project.  "As GNOME continues to
gain momentum, we needed a forum where the GNOME developers and corporate
partners can come together to coordinate the continued development of GNOME.
The support of these industry leaders will help us to achieve our dream of
building a fully free, easy to use desktop environment that will be used by
many millions of people."</p>

<p>The foundation will help set the technical direction of the GNOME project,
promote the broad adoption of GNOME on Linux and Unix desktops and offer a
forum for industry leaders to contribute to GNOME. The Bonobo component
project, GTK toolkit development, Pango internationalization, GNOME Office
integration and other projects will be embraced under the GNOME organization.
The foundation will be modeled on the Apache Foundation, with a board of
directors elected by the hundreds of volunteer GNOME developers.</p>


<h3>GNOME Advisory Board</h3>

<p>The GNOME project also announced the creation of an Advisory Board which
will allow corporations and other organizations to support GNOME.  Initial
members of the Advisory Board include: Compaq, Eazel, Free Software Foundation,
Gnumatic, Hewlett-Packard, Helix Code, Henzai, IBM, Object Management Group,
Red Hat, Sun Microsystems, TurboLinux and VA Linux.</p>

<h3>About GNOME and the GNOME Foundation</h3>

<p>The GNOME project has built a completely free and easy-to-use desktop
environment, as well as a powerful application framework for software
developers on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.   The GNOME
Foundation will provide organizational, financial and legal support to the
GNOME project, and help determine its vision and roadmap.  CollabNet, the
leading provider of collaborative software development services based on open
source principles, is helping to organize the GNOME Foundation.  GNOME is part
of the GNU project, an effort to build a completely free Unix-like operating
system better known as GNU/Linux or Linux.  Additional information is available
at <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</a>.</p>

<p>You are invited to participate in the GNOME Foundation. We welcome
contributions in many forms. Our membership consists of those individuals who
have demonstrated a commitment to the development of GNOME through
participation in the development, documentation and promotion of GNOME. An
Advisory Board provides a vehicle for organizations and companies to
communicate with the GNOME community and support GNOME. Additional information
is available at <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</a>.</p>

<h3>Quote Sheet:</h3>

<p>"It's always great to see companies coming together and working to bring
open source technologies to the next level," said Brian Behlendorf, CTO &amp;
co-founder, CollabNet.  "The creation of the Gnome Foundation will help move
Linux beyond the operating system to becoming a viable desktop application and
CollabNet is excited to be participating in this process."</p>

<p>"Compaq is pleased to join the Advisory Board of the GNOME Foundation,
continuing Compaq's long-time support of the Linux community and open source,"
said Glenn Johnson, Director of Compaq's Linux Program Office.  "Compaq expects
the foundation will be a valuable forum for us, other vendors, and customers to
contribute to the GNOME Project."</p>

<p>"Eazel is delighted to be a member of the Foundation and to be building
software on the GNOME platform," said Mike Boich, CEO and co-founder of Eazel.
"Much like the Apache Project before it, GNOME is benefiting from the interest
of both developers and commercial entities.  The GNOME Foundation can only help
to accelerate that trend."</p>

<p>Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation said: "16 years ago, we
began developing the GNU operating system, a replacement for the Unix operating
system that would be entirely Free Software (free as in freedom).  We aimed to
give GNU the full scope of Unix, including compilers, editors, email software,
even games.  But beyond that, we hoped someday to give a GNU graphical
interface like the Macintosh.  Our third attempt at that, the one that
succeeded, is GNOME, started in 1997 by Miguel de Icaza.  GNOME, like all of
GNU, is a project of the Free Software Movement, which has been working since
1984 to give software users the freedom to redistribute and change software.
The rival Open Source Movement was founded in 1998 to avoid raising issues of
freedom and principle as we try to do.  Supporters of that movement contribute
to work on GNOME, but GNOME is not part of that movement.  See <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</a>
for more explanation."</p>

<p>"Gnumatic Incorporated sees the Gnome Foundation as a major key to the
creation of desktop and home user applications for Linux," said Dr.  Linas
Vepstas, CEO of Gnumatic Incorporated. "By providing a stable desktop
development platform for Linux, applications such as GnuCash, the personal
finance manager being developed by Gnumatic, will benefit from the broad array
of standard Gnome technologies."</p>

<p>"We created Helix Code to deploy a free, modern and friendly desktop
solution to the world," said Nat Friedman, CEO and co-founder of Helix Code.
"Helix GNOME has brought a new level of accessibility and functionality to the
hundreds of thousands of users who have installed our product.  For GNOME, the
next step is applications.  Helix Code comes to the table with Evolution, a
comprehensive communications and information management suite.  Now, industry
and developer support has rallied around the GNOME platform and major
contributions are coming in from all sides.  We will soon offer a total desktop
solution that will reshape the industry. GNOME has arrived."</p>

<p>"HP is excited to join the GNOME foundation and will take an active role in
working with the open source community to contribute to the future desktop
standard for Linux and UNIX systems."  said Martin Fink, R&D Lab Manager for
UNIX Systems Enablement.  "HP is migrating the HP-UX desktop to GNOME towards a
goal of common look and feel between HP-UX and Linux."</p>

<p>"By partnering with industry leaders in the GNOME Foundation, IBM continues
its strong commitment to open standards and a clear vision of Linux as the
driving force for the evolution of e-business," said Daniel Frye, program
director, IBM Linux Technology Center.  "IBM believes this partnership will
help enable innovation and will accelerate development of the Linux
desktop."</p>

<p>"One of the challenges the Linux community is facing is how to integrate the
new applications that are currently being developed with the established
architectures that already exist in most business enterprises.  GNOME
developers have realized that building it around CORBA allows them to use
components that integrate with other industry-recognized technologies, such as
Java and C++.  The OMG is well aware of the need for vendor-neutral
organizations that allow developers to agree upon standard interfaces.  We look
forward to helping the GNOME Foundation in their mission, " said Dr. Richard
Soley, CEO, Object Management Group.</p>

<p>"About three years ago, Red Hat created the Red Hat Advanced Development
Labs (RHAD Labs) to support open source  software on the desktop and
became the first commercial company to make a contribution to GNOME
development," said Bob Young, Chairman and co-founder of Red Hat. "With
the formation of the GNOME Foundation, GNOME is truly coming of age in
terms of market momentum.  We are excited about the opportunities for
GNOME and open source, and we look forward to working with the new
members to the GNOME community, like Eazel, Helix, Sun Microsystems and
others, as they bring applications and technology to the GNOME desktop
environment."</p>

<p>"Sun is thrilled to be joining the GNOME Foundation and we plan to adopt
GNOME as the future desktop for Solaris," said Marco Boerries, vice president
and general manager of webtop and application software at Sun Microsystems,
Inc.  "We are committed to contributing significant engineering resources to
the GNOME project and will work closely with the other GNOME members to ensure
continued reliability and quality."</p>

<p>"TurboLinux is please to support the GNOME Foundation," said Rok Sosic,
TurboLinux Chief Technology Officer. "We have used GNOME as our default desktop
since 1999, and we've been very pleased with the progress that it has made
toward becoming a full-featured standard.  GNOME is one of the best examples of
how open source software can succeed.  Such wide ranging support from the
industry is guaranteed to help the project achieve it's goals."</p>

<p>"VA Linux Systems has been proud to make GNOME available on our systems for
years," said Dr. Larry M. Augustin, president and CEO of VA Linux Systems.
"GNOME is representative of the kind of creativity and engineering that is
available from the Open Source development community. We have a number of
engineers who have worked on GNOME and GTK technology for some time, and are
pleased to extend our GNOME efforts by joining the GNOME foundation."</p>

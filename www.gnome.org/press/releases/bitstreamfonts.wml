GNOME FOUNDATION AND BITSTREAM INC. ANNOUNCE LONG-TERM
AGREEMENT TO BRING HIGH QUALITY FONTS TO FREE SOFTWARE


Ten fonts will be released for use under a special
open license agreement, giving advanced font
capabilities to all free and open source software
developers and users. 

NEW YORK, New York  January 22, 2003  

In a move to fill the last remaining gap in font display
capabilities for open source software, the GNOME
Foundation has reached an agreement with Bitstream
(NASDAQ: BITS) to release fonts under an open source
license.  A total of ten serif, sans serif and
monospaced fonts will be released under a special open
source license, after they have been adapted to meet
the requirements for technical use.  The set of ten
fonts will bring advanced font capabilities to all
developers and users of free and open source software.

"The donation of these fonts to the free software
community is the final piece that will give full
functionality to projects like Freetype, XFT2 and X
Render extensions of the XFree86 project, Pango, KDE
and Trolltechs QT, among many others." said Jim
Gettys of HP and GNOME Foundation board member. 
"These fonts will be available to all developers and
users, giving GNOME and other open source programs a
great look right out of the box that has been lacking
until now."

The Bitstream Vera fonts will be available for free
copying and redistribution and can be modified as long
as the font name is changed.  The fonts cannot be
packaged by themselves for sale, but can be sold with
any software.  The GNOME Foundation will incorporate
the fonts into future GNOME releases, giving end users
of all levels, as well as GNOME developers, the
advanced display capabilities they offer.

"Bitstream has had a long relationship with the
developer community," explained Bob Thomas, director
of product management, Bitstream. "Were very happy to
contribute these fonts to the open source community
and we hope that developers will generate new fonts
and continue to enhance the experience of end-users at
all levels."

"GNOME was created to give free software users a
friendly, powerful desktop environment," said Miguel
de Icaza, GNOME Foundation president and CTO of
Ximian, Inc.  "This agreement with Bitstream will
enhance the experience and graphics capabilities of
corporate, enterprise, educational, governmental and
individual GNOME users and will give powerful tools to
open source developers everywhere."

"Bitstream's generous donation is a tangible measure
of the importance and growth of open source," said
Russ Nelson, VP of the Open Source Initiative. "I
praise the GNOME Foundations efforts to bring this
agreement into being."

The agreement between Bitstream and the GNOME
Foundation will bring invaluable tools to open source
developers and users worldwide.

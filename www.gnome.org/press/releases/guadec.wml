highlighting the capabilities of GNOME, the user environment for
desktops, networked servers and portable Internet devices.  GUADEC will
also feature meaningful discussions of the future direction of GNOME
development.</p>

<p>"The GNOME Project has more than 700, mostly volunteer, developers
worldwide," said Timothy Ney, GNOME Foundation executive director. 
"GUADEC is a unique event that brings these talented individuals
together to discuss and demonstrate their work and to build roadmaps for
future development. The energy and enthusiasm they bring to GUADEC is
tremendous."</p>

<p>GUADEC is being held April 4-6, 2002 in the Escuela Superior de
Ingenieros in Seville, Spain. The program boasts a stellar lineup of
speakers, including Jon "Maddog" Hall of Linux International, Miguel de
Icaza, GNOME Foundation president and CTO of Ximian, Inc. and Jim
Gettys, Principle Member of Technical Staff, Cambridge Research
Laboratory, Compaq Computer Corporation.</p>

<p>"Since the inception of the GNOME Project in 1997, thanks to the
contributions of thousands of developers worldwide, GNOME has quickly
matured as a computing environment," said Miguel de Icaza, president of
the GNOME Foundation and CTO and co-founder of Ximian, Inc. "In addition
to the efforts of the developer community, strong corporate support has
built up the momentum behind GNOME, helping make it the open source
environment of choice for the corporate desktop. The development goals
we discuss at GUADEC will pave the way for the development of even more
powerful, scalable and stable desktop applications for Linux and UNIX
users.</p>

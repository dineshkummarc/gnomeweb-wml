Foundation leaders and individual, business and government GNOME and

and portable Internet devices.  GUADEC will also feature meaningful
discussions of the future direction of open source development.

"GUADEC has enjoyed an exponential growth over the past four years, and
has had a real impact on open source development and deployment in the
countries we've held the conference," said Timothy Ney, GNOME Foundation
executive director.  "GUADEC is a unique event that brings the people
who are creating GNOME together to discuss and demonstrate their work
and to build roadmaps for future development.  Pair these developers
with IT leaders and government officials and you see some real
electricity."

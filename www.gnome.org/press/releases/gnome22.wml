<h1>GNOME 2.2 DESKTOP AND DEVELOPER PLATFORM RELEASED</h1>

<p>Latest version of the popular, multi-platform desktop
environment boasts improved usability and a host of
new utilities and applications.</p>

<p>BOSTON, Mass - The GNOME Foundation today announced
the release of version 2.2 of the GNOME Desktop and
Developer Platform.  Building on the developer
platform advances of GNOME 2.0 and extensive work on
usability and accessibility, users and administrators
on all levels can look forward to a mature, flexible
and powerful user interface, as well as a host of new
applications and utilities.  Developers can look
forward to a more mature application development
platform with several new developer programs and the
advantages of GNOME's component-based architecture.</p>

<p>"GNOME 2.2 release signals a new era in GNOME
development," said Miguel de Icaza, president of the
GNOME Foundation and CTO and co-founder of Ximian,
Inc.  "The GNOME Release Team has attracted some of
the best developers in the world and has moved to a
more mature, schedule-based release program 
culminating in the enhanced functionality and
usability of GNOME 2.2."</p>

<p>GNOME is supported on a variety of platforms,
including GNU/Linux (more commonly referred to as
Linux), Solaris(TM) Operating Environment, HP-UX,
Unix, BSD and Apple's Darwin.  The enhanced user
interface features a commitment to accessibility and
also boasts powerful features such as high-quality
smooth text rendering and first class
internationalization support, including support for
bi-directional text. GNOME 2.2 also brings to the
desktop the first appearance of a new multimedia
framework, called Gstreamer.</p>

<p>"We're seeing the results of the GNOME 2.0 Developer
Platform, which was released last year," said Jeff
Waugh, GNOME Foundation board member and GNOME release
team chair. "The industrial-strength GTK+ 2.0
toolkit, combined with add-on tools such as Glade,
Python and our CORBA implementation make GNOME the
natural choice for developers on a variety of
platforms. GNOME 2.2 is the result."</p>

<p>GNOME 2.2 also features improved theming, with the
addition of icon themes, making the user experience
much better and more customizable.</p>

Desktop and Developer Platform may freely download the
software at www.gnome.org.  The software includes the
GNOME 2.2 desktop interface, file manager, menus and

tools and libraries.</p>

<p>A number GNOME 2.2 versions of popular applications
are available, with more to come later in 2003. GNOME
2.2 will be available later this year on the Solaris
(TM) Operating Environment, HP-UX, Red Hat Linux and

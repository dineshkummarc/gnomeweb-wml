<h1>SWEEPING INITIATIVE PUTS 80,000 COMPUTERS RUNNING GNOME INTO STUDENTS'
HANDS IN THE REGION OF EXTREMADURA, SPAIN</h1>

<p><i>The regional government of Extremadura, Spain has put 80,000 computers in
schools, loaded with GNOME, Linux and other open source software. The ratio is
one computer for every two students.</i></p>

<p><i>Regional government installs one computer for every two students, all
running open source software.  Additional initiatives put computers in hands of
general population.</i></p>


<p>DUBLIN, Ireland  June 18, 2003  Representatives of the Junta of Extremadura
(regional government) announced that a sweeping initiative has put 80,000
computers in schools across that region.  The announcement came at the 4th
annual GNOME Users and Developers European Conference (GUADEC) in Dublin,
Ireland.</p>

<p>The program, which was instituted last year, has just completed installation
in schools, with a ratio of one computer for every two students.  All of the
computers are using a customized version of Linux, called GNU/LinEx, and
features the GNOME desktop.  Other free software productivity programs are also
installed on every computer.  The total cost savings exceeded 18 million euros,
or nearly one third of the total budget of 67 million euros.</p>

<p>"For us, software libre (open source software) was the only choice," said
Francisco A. Huertas Mendez, technical coordinator of GNU/LinuEx of the Junta
de Extremadura. "We were able to stretch our budget very far and provide a
powerful and easy-to-use environment with Linux and GNOME.  We are also able to
give the students all of the productivity programs they need."</p>

<p>The Junta of Extremadura has also created 33 computing centers for the
general population.  The centers feature one-on-one computer assistance, so
users who are unfamiliar with computers can learn computer and e-mail basics.
The centers have drawn citizens of all ages and walks of life.  The oldest user
of the centers is 99 years old.</p>

<p>"Extremadura has launched a very significant initiative, and we are
extremely pleased that they chose to use GNOME as their desktop environment for
Linux," said Miguel de Icaza, CTO of Ximian, Inc.  and GNOME Foundation
president.  "This initiative not only gives computing ability to all of its
students, it also has the potential to grow a local IT industry in Extremadura.
This is an excellent example of the control and flexibility that Linux and open
source give governments and public sector institutions."</p>

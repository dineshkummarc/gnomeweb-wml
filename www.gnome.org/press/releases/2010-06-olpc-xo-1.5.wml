<h1>Sugar Learning Platform and GNOME Desktop Now Shipping on the One Laptop
per Child XO-1.5; Will Run On New XO-HS</h1>

<p>
ASUNCIÓN, June 14, 2010 – Sugar Labs, the GNOME Free Desktop Project, and One
Laptop per Child (OLPC) have announced an update to the software offered on the
OLPC XO-1.5. The 1.5 million children already using Sugar on the original XO-1
can also benefit from the update, since Paraguay Educa has backported the
software.
</p>

<p>
The Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through
child-friendly Activities that encourage critical thinking. The GNOME free
desktop is a hallmark of all major GNU/Linux distributions, suitable for older
children and grownups. Switching between the two environments takes only a
single click. With GNOME on the XO laptop, the door is opened to thousands of
additional educational and productivity applications.
</p>

<p>
The XO-1.5 has the same industrial design as the original XO-1. Based on a VIA
processor, it provides 2× the speed of the XO-1, 4× DRAM memory, and 4× FLASH
memory. OLPC has announced the availability of a high-school edition of the
XO-1.5, the XO-HS, with a newly designed keyboard, more comfortable for older
students. The first deployment of the XO-HS is set to begin in Uruguay under
the highly successful Plan Ceibal in September.
</p>

<p>
Children familiar with the XO-1 will naturally grow into the XO-1.5 with its
expanded functionality. "One Laptop per Child promotes open-source software so
that it can grow and adapt to the needs of the child. The Sugar platform on the
XO is key to our educational mission because it gives students a unique and
intuitive learning software environment," said OLPC Association CEO Rodrigo
Arboleda.
</p>

<p>
Stormy Peters, Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, said, "We're really
excited to be working with Sugar and OLPC to provide desktop software to
children of all ages. GNOME's mission is to provide a free desktop accessible
to everyone. Children from Uruguay to Ghana will be able to use their XOs to
learn and to show their friends and families how to use Sugar and GNOME."
</p>

<p>
Walter Bender, Executive Director of Sugar Labs, said "the fluidity of movement
between the two desktops gives learners the ability to transition from a
learning environment – Sugar – to a production and productivity environment –
GNOME. They have the means of honing the creative skills acquired in an
elementary education setting into entrepreneurial skills in a secondary
education setting."
</p>

<p>
"Sugar on a Stick" allows children who don't have an XO laptop to benefit from
this new software. Available for download from Sugar Labs in the new, v3
Mirabelle flavor, it can be loaded onto an ordinary USB thumbdrive and used to
start a PC in Sugar without touching the hard disk. The XO laptops and Sugar on
a Stick run Fedora GNU/Linux

<h1>Users with Disabilities Get Built-in Assistive Technology Solutions with
the GNOME 2.0 Desktop</h1>

<p><i>New developments make the GNOME 2.0 Desktop more accessible to the needs
of users with disabilities.</i></p>

<p>New York, N.Y. January 28, 2002 - The GNOME Foundation today announced the
latest innovative assistive technology contributions to the GNOME project, an
open-source, free-software desktop for GNU/Linux and UNIX.  BAUM Retec AG
delivers the first full-featured GNOME screen magnifier, a screen reader, and a
set of Braille drivers to meet the needs of vision-impaired users and the
Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University of Toronto is delivering the
first GNOME on-screen keyboard to support users with motor impairments. These
built-in assistive technologies seamlessly integrate with a new generation of
accessible applications as they enable users with disabilities to easily
interact with applications that can adapt to their needs.</p>

<p>These new assistive technologies leverage Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s
contribution of the GNOME Accessibility Framework. This framework based on an
open architecture, provides a comprehensive toolkit and APIs, that developers
can use to create accessible applications and interface them with assistive
technologies on any UNIX or GNU/Linux platform running the GNOME 2.0 desktop.
With the combination of the Accessibility Framework and assistive technologies,
users with disabilities have the solutions they need to get their job done
efficiently:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Screen Magnifier - enables users with low vision to enlarge the
	computer screen and interact with the magnified portion of the screen they
	are accessing, such as menus, toolbars, graphics, and text.</li>

	<li>Screen Reader - allows users who are blind or visually impaired to
	access information on the computer screen through a Braille display or
	synthesized speech. With screen readers users can read and edit text,
	manipulate menu bars, buttons and dialog boxes, and fully interact with the
	GNOME desktop.</li>

	<li>On-screen Keyboard - provides users with physical impairments a wide
	variety of ways to enter text and manipulate the graphical user interface
	of applications and the GNOME desktop. In addition, environments without a
	keyboard, such as a touch screen kiosk, can take advantage of the on-screen
	keyboard. This on-screen keyboard goes beyond the standard physical
	keyboard, it supports word prediction, scanning access, coded access,
	customizable keyboard layouts, and dynamic keyboard functionality that
	conveniently places menu bar options and other application elements onto
	the keyboard display for direct manipulation.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Integrating accessibility technology solutions with the GNOME desktop
allows anyone to use GNOME," said Miguel de Icaza, GNOME Foundation President.
These built-in capabilities provide enterprises with a ready-to-go and
comprehensive accessible desktop that adapts to the needs of users with
disabilities. The benefits are vast - for IT organizations this cost-effective
alternative resolves the problem of buying and installing expensive complex
software; for disabled users it's simpler and more convenient to work and
collaborate with team members since they have the advantage of using any UNIX
or GNU/Linux platform running the GNOME 2.0 desktop".</p>

<p>"We chose GNOME because of its open, extensible, and comprehensive
accessibility architecture," said Thomas Friehoff, CTO, head of software
development of BAUM Retec AG. "Using the open Assistive Technologies Service
Provider API we were able to deliver our solutions quickly, because it
eliminated the need to reinvent assistive technology software for different
UNIX platforms, saving us time and costs".</p>

<p>"Our center in Toronto specializes in developing information technologies
that include seamless accessible interfaces," said Jutta Treviranus, Director,
Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University of Toronto. "The GNOME
Accessibility Framework free software project enables us to leverage the
component-based architecture to develop technologies that intelligently
integrate alternative access techniques.  Using this approach we will make the
user interface accessible and usable by the large group of individuals who
cannot use a standard keyboard or mouse. We will continue working with the
GNOME open source project to develop new kinds of user input support, including
an open source keyboard configuration editor that provides ways to improve the
efficiency of computer interaction for users with disabilities."</p>

<p>"By providing rich and consistent interfaces for both assistive technologies
and applications, the accessibility framework enables flexible and
comprehensive accessibility solutions for GNOME," said Bill Haneman, GNOME
Accessibility Architect, Sun Microsystems, Inc. "A key aspect of the GNOME
Accessibility Framework is support for user interface component sets beyond the
built-in GNOME component set," said Peter Korn, Sun Accessibility Architect.
"The thousands of applications that take advantage of the Java Accessibility
API will work with the GNOME Accessibility Framework unaltered and gain the
benefit of the assistive technologies included with the GNOME 2.0 Desktop. In
addition, other important applications, such as the OpenOffice.org productivity
suite, are being modified to use these technologies."</p>

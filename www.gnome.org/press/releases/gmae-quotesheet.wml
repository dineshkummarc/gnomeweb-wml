systems has long been a difficult and error-prone decision. With
the GNOME Mobile &amp; Embedded Initiative, the power of the GNOME
desktop becomes available to the embedded world, of course as truly
Open Source Software. The founding members of GMAE include open
source project members, device manufacturers already using GNOME
technologies and a number of consultancies who can provide expert
guidance and services. Codethink has worked hard on bringing core
GNOME and Freedesktop technologies such as HAL and D-Bus into the

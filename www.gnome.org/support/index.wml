<h1>GNOME Support</h1>

<p>
There's a lively community around GNOME and we're happy to help you 
if possible. The following list points to several options you can choose.
</p>

<p>
However, GNOME interacts with a large number of other software projects. 
In most cases, the Internet homepage of your distribution is thus 
a better place to start. So we recommend that you first check the support options of your distribution.
</p>


<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>GNOME comes with full documentation. We provide a User Guide, a 
System Administrator Guide, and an Accessibility Guide. See our
<a href="/learn/">complete documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Knowledge base</h3>

<p>A list of frequently answered questions (FAQ) and other helpful resources 
can be found in our <a href="http://gnomesupport.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">
knowledge base</a>.

It is provided in form of a wiki &ndash; an online resource 
everybody is allowed to change.</p>

<h3>User forum</h3>

<p>To contact others users, get help, and discuss topics around GNOME,
	join our <a href="http://gnomesupport.org/forums/">user forum</a>.

	Note that developers rarely read its topics, so it's not a proper way to 
	request a feature, or report a bug.</p>

	<h3>Mailing lists</h3>

	<p>The <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-list">GNOME 
	List</a> is a good place to ask general questions about GNOME. Often, 
	your question has been asked before. You can find an answer
	by browsing or searching the 
	<a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-list/">list archive</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>IRC channels</h3>

	<p>The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) network with the largest GNOME presence 
is GIMPnet, with the channels #gnome-help (for getting help with GNOME)
	and #gnome (for developer discussion) being the main resources.</p>

	<h3>Report a bug</h3>

	<p>Something seems to be not working as it should? You desperately miss 
	a certain feature?

	Be sure to report in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">GNOME 
	Bugzilla</a>. If you're new to Bugzilla, you may find the 
	<a href="">Simple Bug Assistant</a> easier to use.</p>

	<!-- <h3>Commercial support</h3>

	<p>
	// Mention the commercial support option, and a pointer to a list 
	of companies that provide support, training, and custom development.
	</p>

	<h3>Books</h3>

	<p>
	// Mention the option to buy a good book, and a pointer to a list 
	of books about 'default GNOME' distributions, and books related to GNOME.

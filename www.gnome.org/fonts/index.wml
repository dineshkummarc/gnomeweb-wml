      <h1><a href="http://www.bitstream.com">Bitstream</a> Vera Fonts -
April 16, 2003</h1>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Please upgrade to the final
fonts <a
 href="#Final_Bitstream_Vera_Fonts">(under
the final copyright)</a> now that they are available, and discard the
beta test versions. Please <a
 href="#Release_Notes">read
the release notes</a> before <a
 href="#Reporting_Problems">reporting
problems</a> with the fonts.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/ttf-bitstream-vera/1.10/">The fonts are now available here</a>.<br>
      <br>
      </span>Note that the Vera copyright is incorporated in the fonts
themselves.&nbsp; The License field in the fonts contains the copyright
license as it appears below. The TrueType copyright field is not large
enough to contain the full license, so the license is incorporated (as
you might think if you thought about it) into the license field, which
unfortunately can be obscure to find.&nbsp; (In pfaedit, see:
Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;TTFNames-&gt;License).<br>
      <br>
Our apologies for it taking longer to complete the fonts than
planned.&nbsp; Beta testers requested a tighter line spacing (less
leading) and Jim Lyles redesigned Vera's accents to bring its line
spacing to more typical of other fonts.&nbsp; This took additional time
and effort.&nbsp; Our thanks to Jim for this effort above and beyond the
call of duty.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>There are four monospace and sans faces (normal, oblique,
bold, bold oblique) and two serif faces (normal and bold).
Fontconfig/Xft2 can artificially oblique the serif faces for you: this
loses hinting and distorts the faces slightly, but is visibly different
than normal and bold, and reasonably pleasing.<br>
      <br>
On systems with fontconfig 2.0 or 2.1 installed, making your sans,
serif and monospace fonts default to these fonts is very easy.
&nbsp;Just drop the file <a href="local.conf">local.conf</a> into your
/etc/fonts directory. &nbsp;This will make the Bitstream fonts your
default fonts for all applications using fontconfig (if sans, serif, or
monospace names are used, as they often are as default values in many
desktops). The XML in local.conf may need modification to enable
subpixel decimation, if appropriate, however, the commented out phrase
does so for XFree86 4.3, in the case that the server does not have
sufficient information to identify the use of a flat panel.&nbsp;
Fontconfig 2.2 adds Vera to the list of font families and will, by
default use it as the default sans, serif and monospace fonts.<br>
      <h3><a name="Release_Notes"></a>Release Notes</h3>
During the testing of the final Vera fonts, we learned that screen
fonts in general are only typically hinted to work correctly at integer
pixel sizes.&nbsp; Vera is coded internally for integer sizes
only.&nbsp; We need to investigate further to see if there are commonly
used fonts that are hinted to be rounded but are not rounded to integer
sizes due to oversights in their coding.<br>
      <br>
Most fonts work best at 8 pixels and below if anti-aliased only, as the
amount of work required to hint well at smaller and smaller sizes
becomes astronomical.&nbsp; GASP tables are typically used to control
whether hinting is used or not, but Freetype/Xft does not currently
support GASP tables (which are present in Vera).<br>
      <br>
To mitigate this problem, both for Vera and other fonts, there will be
(very shortly) a <a href="http://www.fontconfig.org">new fontconfig
2.2 release</a> that will, by default not apply hints if the size is
below 8 pixels. if you should have a font that in fact has been hinted
more agressively, you can use fontconfig to note this exception. We
believe this should improve many hinted fonts in addition to Vera,
though implemeting GASP support is likely the right long term solution.<br>
      <br>
Font rendering in Gnome or KDE is the combination of algorithms in Xft2
and <a href="http://www.freetype.org">Freetype</a>, along with hinting
in the fonts themselves. It is vital to have sufficient information to
disentangle problems that you may observe.<br>
      <br>
Note that having your font rendering system set up correctly is vital
to proper judgement of problems of the fonts:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Freetype may or may not be configured to in ways that may
implement execution of <a
 href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html">possibly patented</a>
(in some parts of the world) TrueType hinting algorithms, particularly
at small sizes. &nbsp;Best results are obtained while using these
algorithms.</li>
        <li>The freetype autohinter (used when the possibly patented
algorithms are not used) continues to improve with each release. If you
are using the autohinter, please ensure you are using an up to date
version of freetype before reporting problems.</li>
        <li>Please identify what version of freetype you are using in
any bug reports, and how your freetype is configured.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Make sure you are not using the freetype version included
in XFree86 4.3, as it has bugs that significantly degrade most fonts,
including Vera. if you build XFree86 4.3 from source yourself, you may
have installed this broken version without intending it (as I did). Vera
was verified with the recently released Freetype 2.1.4. On many systems,
'ldd" can be used to see which freetype shared library is actually being
used.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Xft/X Render does not (yet) implement gamma correction.
&nbsp;This causes significant problems rendering white text on a black
background (causing partial pixels to be insufficiently shaded) if the
gamma of your monitor has not been compensated for, and minor problems
with black text on a while background. &nbsp;The program "xgamma" can be
used to set a gamma correction value in the X server's color pallette.
Most monitors have a gamma near 2.</li>
        <li>Note that the Vera family uses minimal delta hinting. Your
results on other systems when not used anti-aliased may not be entirely
satisfying. We are primarily interested in reports of problems on open
source systems implementing Xft2/fontconfig/freetype (which implements
antialiasing and hinting adjustements, and sophisticated subpixel
decimation on flatpanels). &nbsp;Also, the algorithms used by Xft2
adjust the hints to integer widths and the results are crisper on open
source systems than on Windows or MacIntosh.</li>
        <li>Your fontconfig may (probably does) predate the release of
fontconfig 2.2, and you may see artifacts not present when the font is
used at very small sizes with hinting enabled. "fc-list -V" can be used
to see what version you have installed.</li>
      </ul>
We believe and hope that these fonts will resolve the problems reported
during beta test.&nbsp; The largest change is the reduction of leading
(interline spacing), which had annoyed a number of people, and reduced
Vera's utility for some applcations.&nbsp; The Vera monospace font
should also now make '0' and 'O' and '1' and 'l' more clearly
distinguishable.<br>
      <br>
The version of these fonts is version 1.10.&nbsp; Fontconfig should be
choosing the new version of the fonts if both the released fonts and
beta test fonts are installed (though please discard them: they have
names of form tt20[1-12]gn.ttf).&nbsp; Note that older versions of
fontconfig sometimes did not rebuild their cache correctly when new
fonts are installed: please upgrade to fontconfig 2.2. "fc-cache -f" can
be used to force rebuilding fontconfig's cache files manually on older
fontconfig installations.<br>

      </div>
      <tt> </tt>If you note problems, please send them to fonts at
gnome dot org, with exactly which face and size and unicode point you
observe the problem at. The xfd utility from XFree86 CVS may be useful
for this (e.g. "xfd -fa sans"). &nbsp;A possibly more useful program to
examine fonts at a variety of sizes is the "waterfall" program found in
Keith Packard's CVS.<br>

      <h3>Copyright FAQ</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I don't understand the
resale restriction... What gives?</span><br>
Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
competitors can't just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system and
sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can't make money from
the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to do so
either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package, however.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I want to package these
fonts separately for distribution and sale as part of a larger software
package or system. &nbsp;Can I do so?</span><br>
Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin
with, and you aren't selling them independently by themselves. See 1.
above.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Are derivative works
allowed?</span><br>
Yes!</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Can I change or add to the
font(s)?</span><br>
Yes, but you <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> change the
name(s) of the font(s).<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Under what terms are
derivative works allowed?</span><br>
You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the quality
of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to ensure
that if an application has opened a font specifically of these names, it
gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig, substitutions
could still could have occurred during font opening). You must include
the Bitstream copyright. Additional copyrights can be added, as per
copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!<br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">If I have improvements for
Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get adopted in future versions?</span><br>
Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to the
Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
entire family, not just a single font, and that you'll have to keep both
Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, happy! To make sense to add glyphs
to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera's design.
Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be providing a
document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a guide and aid
for people interested in contributing to Vera, when he gets back from a
well-deserved vacation.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">I want to sell a software
package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?</span><br>
Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software with
the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">If applications have built
the names "Bitstream Vera" into them, can I override this somehow to use
fonts of my choosing?</span><br>
This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source systems
and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to use
fontconfig (see <a href="http://www.fontconfig.org">www.fontconfig.org</a>)
to handle font configuration, selection and substitution; it has
provisions for overriding font names and subsituting alternatives. An
example is provided by the supplied local.conf file, which chooses the
family Bitstream Vera for "sans", "serif" and "monospace". &nbsp;Other
software (e.g., the XFree86 core server) has other mechanisms for font
substitution.<br>

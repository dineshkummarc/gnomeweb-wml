<h2>GNOME Foundation Achievements</h2>

<h3>GNOME is a free and open source desktop. Because GNOME is free, every contribution put into GNOME is available to everyone. GNOME is:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Used by millions of school children worldwide on the XO "One Laptop Per Child" project<li>
<li>Available in all major world languages, including 3rd world languages</li> 
<li>Supports accessibility so that it can be used by all people, including users with limited mobility and vision problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>During 2008 the GNOME Foundation was able to help bring a free and open source desktop to the world by doing the following:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Participated in Google Summer of Code in which 30 students and mentors participated. They worked on improving f-spot (an application to manage photos), improving anjuta (IDE), improving cheese (webcam application, similar to photobooth), and working on avahi to support LLMNR (which is the windows technology similar to zeroconf, iirc). See a complete list of projects <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/gnome/about.html">here</a>.</li>

<li>Ran an Accessibility Outreach Program that resulted in improvements in documentation, magification and mouse control through a webcam. In addition, several smaller tasks like bug fixing were accomplished as well. See a complete list of the tasks <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/outreach/a11y/tasks/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Held a GTK+ hackfest that was widely seen as successful for getting the GTK+ developers in the same place and was essential to planning the future of GTK+. We plan to build on this success by using the hackfest model for other GNOME technologies. We are currently planning hackfests for introspection, usability, search</li> 
<li>Held several world wide developer conferences to enable developers to collaborate effectively and to educate new users and developers.  In Europe, our volunteer run conference, GUADEC, brought 300 GNOME developers together.  This year we will have the first GNOME event in Asia, GNOME.Asia, to be held October 18-19th in Beijing. We are planning for 300 Asian attendees. </li>
</ul>

<h3>In 2009, we could use your help to accomplish the following:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Produce more end user and need focused technology and features through technology specific hackfests. Hackfests are an event where a core team of project developers get together and spend a week in the same local, discussing plans and writing code. They are particularly useful for getting new projects or large features launched (like GTK+ 3.0) or getting a large amount of code written.</li>
<li>Ensure a free and secure desktop environment for everyone. 
Continue to provide a neutral, confidential place for our sponsors to discuss their GNOME technology related plans. 
Organize a usability study focused on GNOME technologies used by all people including children, users in developing nations and people with accessibility needs.</li>
<li>Have more active dialogs between our sponsor companies and our developers through monthly advisory board meetings. This is one way to bring end user and distribution company needs to GNOME developers.</li>
<li>Hold a joint GUADEC/Akademy conference, a Free Desktop Summit, in order to encourage collaboration and common specifications.</li>
<li>Ensure that there is a free and open source stack for mobile devices by working with other mobile groups to define and produce GNOME Mobile.</li>
<li>Hire a system administrator to manage the GNOME infrastructure so that our contributors can focus on improving GNOME.</li> 
<li>Support local conferences like GNOME.Asia, GUADLAC (Latin America), Boston Summit, GNOME.conf.au (Australia) and Forum GNOME as a forum for community building, technology sharing, and bringing developers, companies and users closer together. 
Start an internship program aimed at exposing business students to the free and open source software world and bringing their expertise to some of the marketing and business challenges we have.</li>
<li>Support the community on defining and executing a release plan for GNOME 3.0.</li>
<li>Encourage more donations from individuals by revamping our Friends of GNOME program and adding an automatic renewal option. Our current program brings in $6,000/year with no advertising. We think we can build on this with better infrastructure and marketing.</li>

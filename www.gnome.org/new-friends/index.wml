Thanks to our donations, 
in 2008  we were able to:
<ul>

<li>Run an Accessibility Outreach Program that resulted in 6 long-term tasks completed with three more on going in documentation, magification and mouse control through a webcam.</li>

<li>Organise a GTK+ hackfest that was widely seen as successful for getting the GTK+ developers in the same place and was essential to planning the future of GTK+. We plan to build on this success by using the hackfest </li>

<li>Planning the first GNOME event in Asia, GNOME.Asia, to be held October </li>

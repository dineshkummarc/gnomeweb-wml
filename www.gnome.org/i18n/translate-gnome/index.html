>      How do I translate the GNOME desktop to other languages than english?
      This is a question that pops up quite frequently on the various GNOME
      mailing-lists and IRC channels. Well, this is a feeble attempt 
      at writing a guide to translating all the different parts of
      the GNOME desktop environment, and believe me there are a few
      well hidden files containing translatable strings.

>      There are different opinons on what is most important
      when translating. Some think that docs are more important
      and others think that the interface, menus and dialogs
      are more important. This is something that the translator
      must decide for him/herself. I'll try to cover both here.
      My opinion is that they are both of equal importance,
      but that the menus and dialogs are the ones the user first
      meet and so these are what makes the users realize that
      the apps are really available in their own language.
      Of course there is nothing stopping you from doing both
      at once, except time and resources.

      for a translator such as the gettext documentation and 
      a few guides on the web. Look at <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/gdp/doctable/doctable_list.php3?CategoryID=4"
TARGET="_top"
>GNOME documentation project's  doctable</A
>
      for a few pointers to other resources. Also the gettext
      documentation describes how to set up emacs to work with
      .po files in what is called po-mode. I recommend that you try
      this out. I have found it to speed up my own work considerably.

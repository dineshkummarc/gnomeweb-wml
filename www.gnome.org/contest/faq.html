<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p><b>How many times can I enter the contest?</b><p>
<p> One entry per person.</p>

<p><b>Will the designs only be sold on t-shirts?</b></p>
<p> No!  Depending on the design, we would like to sell the winning design

<p><b>How long will the designs be available for sale in the GNOME Store?</b></p>
<p>We haven't decided on how long they will be available for sale, but they
will only available for a limited time.</p>

<p><b>Where did this idea come from?</b></p>
<p>When we originally launched the 
<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/gnome">GNOME Store</a> in 2010, it was 
always a goal to have designs created by the community available for sale.  To
kick this off, we've started the contest!  With GNOME 3.0 coming in early 2011
we thought this was a perfect idea.  We also borrowed ideas from Máirín Duffy,
who organizes the 
<a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com/category/fedora-design-bounty/">Fedora Design Bounties.</a>

<p><b>What license does my design need to be available in?</b></p>
<p>All designs must be submitted under a 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0</a> license.</p>

<p><b>What are the rules?</b></p>
<p>You can read all the <a href="rules.html">rules and fine print here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Who are the judges?</b></p>
<p>Three long time contributors to GNOME Design - Vinicius Depizzol, 
Andreas Nilsson, and Jakub Steiner.  They will be reviewing all submissions
and choosing the first, second and third prize winners.</p>

<p><b>I still have questions, who should I contact?</b></p>

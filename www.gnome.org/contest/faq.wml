<h3>How many times can I enter the contest?</h3>
<p> One entry per person.</p>

<h3>Will the designs only be sold on t-shirts?</h3>
<p> No!  Depending on the design, we would like to sell the winning design
on a number of different kinds of merchandise at the GNOME Zazzle Store.  To 
view the different pieces of merchandise, <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/create">
click here</a>.

<h3>How long will the designs be available for sale in the GNOME Store?</h2>
<p>We haven't decided on how long they will be available for sale, but they
will only available for a limited time.</p>

<h3>Where did this idea come from?</h3>
<p>When we originally launched the 
<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/gnome">GNOME Store</a> in 2010, it was 
always a goal to have designs created by the community available for sale.  To
kick this off, we've started the contest!  With GNOME 3.0 coming in early 2011
we thought this was a perfect idea.  We also borrowed ideas from Máirín Duffy,
who organizes the 
<a href="http://mairin.wordpress.com/category/fedora-design-bounty/">Fedora Design Bounties.</a>

<h3>What license does my design need to be available in?</h3>
<p>All designs must be submitted under a 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0</a> license.</p>

<h3>What are the rules?</h3>
<p>You can read all the <a href="rules.html">rules and fine print here</a>.</p>

<h3>Why are certain countries ineligible for prizes?</h3>
<p>The United States prohibits commerce with 
Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, and Myanmar (Burma).  The GNOME Foundation,
as a licensed non-profit headquartered in the United States, must abide by
these laws.  Residents of these
countries may participate in the contest and if chosen as winners, will be
recognized and their designs chosen for re-sale, but we cannot offer prizes
to residents of these countries.</p>

<h3>Who are the judges?</h3>
<p>Three long time contributors to GNOME Design - Vinicius Depizzol, 
Andreas Nilsson, and Jakub Steiner.  They will be reviewing all submissions
and choosing the first, second and third prize winners.</p>

<h3>I still have questions, who should I contact?</h3>
<p>Please contact the contest administrator, <a href="http://live.gnome.org/PaulCutler">Paul Cutler</a>.</p>
